rennyo " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " mentioned in ;
" {{ achieving enlightenment }} when long time ago , that we could {{ go to heaven }} , who decided mida of the kindness forgetting not faith {{ is what is about }} .
this a big misconception is .
of mida nyorai 's enlightenment achieving the story we know {{ even though }} , that we {{ go to heaven }} can tariki in faith of the story know we {{ do not }} if {{ not mean anything }} it does . "
how nyorai buddha became here that knowing is merely knowledge , nyorai by given tariki in faith ( truth in faith ) of the origin know to and it is important he explained .
here shinjin shoin he confirmed and correctly defined , " simply nenbutsu reciting everyone paradise to takes " mentioned and never .
nyorai by given , faith helps jodo shinshu in people .
definitely nenbutsu gratitude for recited is , {{ going to heaven }} of the condition not .
also shinran " kyogo shinsho " in " {{ nehan ( nirvana }} {{ what gets you to }} {{ only faith }} ) is " mentioned , " songo shinzo meimon " in and " true faith {{ anoku bodai }} ( ultimate enlightenment {{ gets you to }} regard that ) " .

therefore , shinshu homyaku ( {{ master -apprentice }} relationship ) and {{ kechimyaku ( blood relationship }} , {{ which are }} two lineages has ) .
and the given name kaimyo {{ instead of }} homyo called is .
shinshu , ( ojo jobutsu ) only nyorai 's power by trusting ( {{ in other words }} true faith acquiring , if ) everyone {{ go to heaven }} can that its doctrine with , other sects to compared many religious exercises and customs from , is free , {{ ho-on {{ shatoku ( gratitude for kindness }} and virtue }} ) for nenbutsu and {{ mombo ( learning the teachings of buddha }} and {{ makes much of }} ) .

( rennyo {{ hongan-ji temple }} from kechimyaku had since , the founder shinran from homyaku who value the sects use {{ do not }} his work .
rennyo school of hongan-ji and takada school fight and conflict of a history have . )
{{ the founder }} shinran shakamuni and shichi koso to tariki nenbutsu of the lineage {{ took into consideration }} , honen ( of jodo shu the founder ) his master as he regarded after his life it , through " the true religion as jodo shu of the teachings " succeed and to enhance to and {{ devoted himself }} .
{{ honen 's }} {{ after death }} the apprentices by hongan and nenbutsu of interpretations different of jodo shu seizan schools and other criticize made shinran .
" soshi {{ sho 'nin }} ( shinran ) already jodo shinshu established - jodo shu to superior significance it has and he {{ shin ( true }} the letter added it jodo shinshu ) and named . "
the times with jodo shinshu of the name of the view changed , has that this shows .

rennyo of emergence {{ from to }} ishiyama hongan-ji war
muromachi period the late in , who emerged of {{ hongan-ji temple }} , the 8th head-priest rennyo ( 1415-1499 ) , {{ the time }} at the public of of the growth the backdrop against kou called an organization established , for people equally the teachings to learn and to {{ come together }} the opportunity provided , and shinran of the teachings plain words in explaining " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " wrote and the public to it widely disseminated .
his achievement by , {{ hongan-ji temple }} rapidly developed and expanded , ikko shu called be to and came . ( {{ on the contrary }} , other of shinshu sects decline {{ went into }} ) .
this kou in followers of of {{ the group }} the strength rennyo 's restraint , despite politicians ( daimyo {{ such as }} ) at directed was .
of the {{ middle ages }} the end in with complicated lordship and multiple the system with discontent were who the {{ village people }} {{ kokujin ( village heads }} ) and {{ dogo ( powerful families }} shinshu to ) converted and joined , " ikko-ikki " called province or the whole county from ikko {{ shu followers }} by united and uprising {{ throughout the nation }} staged were .
later , when the onin war ( 1467-1477 ) {{ broke out }} and {{ at that time }} echizen province in {{ hongan-ji temple }} of , as the base yoshizaki gobo of north , kaga province in {{ east squads }} and {{ west between an {{ internal conflict }} occurred , senshu-ji school of the monto the {{ west squad }} in who {{ took part }} togashi kochiyo of {{ took the side }} while , honganji school of the monto echizen of , the daimyo asakura takakage ( the 7th chief ) of the assistance , through , in 1474 , kaga from deported and a former shugo , kochiyo 's brother who belonged to {{ east squad }} togashi masachika of {{ took the side }} kochiyo , and deported ( {{ in other words }} , kaga in ikko-ikki started shinshu inside as a power struggle was ) .

the term " shijin-so-o china , korea and japan in the heavens of the four directions ' that govern the ' four gods for to be the best suited that are traditionally believed the topography and {{ land physiognomy }} to " refers .
the four gods their center at an ' {{ oryu ( yellow dragon }} ' ) or kirin with the ' {{ go-jin ( five gods }} ' called are ) .
however , the four gods and actual geography between the correspondence that in china , {{ south korea }} {{ , and }} {{ north korea }} from japan in greatly differs .
china and korea of the {{ feng shui }} in {{ shijin-so-o topography }} the back at tall mountains the front in , or sea ) , a lake , river ( sui ) having ( haizan-rinsui in which the terrain {{ both sides }} on ( sa ) hills or , and smaller mountains by enclosed is zofujusui ( wind storing water and collecting ) of the form indicates .
however , {{ ogura-ike pond }} completely {{ consumed by landfills }} was which , kyoto of the {{ shijin-so-o topography }} broke .
{{ suzaku-oji avenue }} overlooked , which once funaoka {{ mt . }} , genbu a little {{ too for }} small is .
the standard {{ feng shui }} of viewpoint in , funaoka {{ mt . }} genbu via , to which {{ sanryu , a dragon of mountains }} , is headed seiho as interpreted is .
modern japan in shown in the {{ following table }} ' as that the four gods ' mountain , river , road and lake , to related are , the interpretation generally accepted , is .
however , this association {{ ancient times }} since settled been necessarily has not .
' the four gods that {{ equates to }} mountain , river , road and lake ' the theory of source is the " {{ sakuteiki gardening book }} " .
the four gods to represent mountain , river , road and lake there {{ is no }} the event in certain kinds of trees planting ' the four gods = mountain , river , road and lake ' substitute can that it also explains .
{{ modern ogura-ike }} japan accepted in that the four gods ' mountain , river , road and lake ' to related are the interpretation generally {{ has been }} since , with heian-kyo a model as seiryu = {{ kamo-gawa river }} ( the {{ yodo-gawa river }} system ) , byakko = sanin-do road , suzaku = pond }} and genbu = funaoka {{ mt . }} of the association relatively successful was .
therefore , {{ this theory }} eighth century the late in built , which was for heian-kyo choosing the land for the ideological background is that the assumption on based the argument of proof there {{ is no }} the {{ fact that }} to {{ pay attention }} we {{ need to }} .
{{ in fact }} , the edo period prior to a city the {{ shijin-so-o topography }} match to designed been would have {{ even though }} the four gods mountain , river , road and lake were that , it is very unlikely .
right now , heijo of the place of four beasts the painting with {{ is in accordance }} ; {{ three mountains }} {{ assuage things }} , and {{ turtle augury }} the same tells . '
the phrase ' of four beasts the painting with accordance ' {{ shijin-so-o topography }} here means , the nara period during heijo-kyo {{ shijin-so-o topography }} having the place to be considered was that which confirms .
heijo-kyo of the location heian-kyo for described as a mountain , river , road and lake to apply {{ doesn 't }} .
however as it {{ shijin-so-o topography }} with is associated , {{ as long }} the nara period during that another interpretation accepted been would have it {{ is likely }} .
kamakura period the late in shirin {{ saiyo-sho commentary }} that ' the {{ central mountains }} genbu to {{ are related }} , and the people , {{ panoply and oven }} suzaku to {{ are related }} , ... ' mentions suzaku ' people , {{ panoply and oven }} ' with associated was that which shows .
moreover , " ryueihikan " ' winds of the edo castle the world 's castle of the position merit , and its land {{ shijin-so-o topography }} with coincides ' that mentions .
such geography of ' four gods = mountain , river , road and lake ' the theory matches that say to far-fetched it is .
furthermore , himeji castle , fukuyama castle ( bingo-no-kuni ) or kumamoto castle ' mountain , river , road and lake ' of matches the {{ shijin-so-o topography }} that the interpretation later emerged theory .
ancient china of the {{ feng shui }} in a certain direction on of certain fortune concept there {{ is no }} , {{ kimon ( the direction of northeast , called an ogre gate }} ) and {{ urakimon ( the direction of southwest which is the opposite side of kimon }} abhor to japanese an original concept so it is ) .
{{ this is how }} {{ shijin-so-o topography }} of the interpretation {{ ancient times }} from the {{ early modern times }} to changed has , ancient china of the {{ feng shui }} from and different unique to be believed and it is .
