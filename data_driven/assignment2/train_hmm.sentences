The good and evil deeds they do are not conditions for salvation .
It shows his distinctiveness as a person of religion .
Honen encouraged people to avoid evil and do good .
The details can be found in the following Bussetsu Muryojukyo :
It is referred to as having a total of 12 translations , meaning the existing five and the seven that are missing .
He also preaches to them the virtue of the sacred who have passed away into ( were born in ) the Pure Land .
" Bussetsu Muryojukyo , Vol . 2 , " which is said to have been translated by Hogo JIKU in West Jin .
Honen : " Kanmuryoju Kyo Shaku " ( Commentary of Kanmuryoju Kyo )
Each meaning is described below in detail .
Shinran wrote , " Tariki means the power or work of the Original Vow made by Amida . "
So the priests of the Jodo kyo interpreted Tariki as the work of the Original Vow made by Amida Buddha .

In this sense the antonym of " Tariki " ( Other Power ) is " Jiriki " ( Self Power ) .
( from the Asahi newspaper , May 28 , 2005 )
The original version written in Sanskrit still exists , as do the Chinese and Tibetan translations .
Because it 's a very short sutra , its other name is " Shishi-kyo " ( literally , the sutra of four papers ) .
Among the existent translations , this is the one that reflects the original most faithfully .
First , it preaches the solemnity of Gokuraku Jodo ( the Land of Perfect Bliss ) , where Amida-Nyorai resides .
Also , some descriptions reflecting the philosophy of ethnic discrimination are seen in this book .
He was the First Patriarch of the Five Patriarchs of Jodo sect , and the Third of the Seven Patriarchs of Jodo shin shu ( True Pure Land Sect Buddhism ) .
Therefore , Tan-luan burned ' Sengyo ( Taoist bible ) , ' and was converted to Jodo sect .
By Imperial order he was buried at Text Valley ( 文谷 ) of West Qinling ( 西秦陵 ) in Fenzhou .
Most of all , his theory forms the basis of Shinran 's doctrine .
Thus he established the doctrine of Jodo sect .
He gave more than 200 lectures to monks and lay believers on " Kanmuryoju-kyo sutra " ( ' The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life , ' meaning Amida ) .
( Shomyo Nenbutsu ) ( invocation of the name of Buddha )
He died on May 27 , 645 at the age of 85 .
Engi in Buddhism
For example , in Kegon doctrine it 's called ' Engi inbun . '
It is an interpretation shown by Interpretation of the Six Characters of Shandao , as mentioned above .
" Gan " refers to the wishes of those among mankind who believe ' Namu ' and Amida Buddha .
Shomyo means the invocation of the name ( s ) of the Buddha and / or Bodhisattva .
Shomyo especially means reciting Namu Amida butsu , which is the myogo ( name ) of Amida Buddha and signifies Homage to Amida Buddha .
This name invoking is a Shojo no go ( a Rightly Established Practice ) in order to be reborn in the Pure Land .
Thus , it certainly is the Shojo no goin ( the Rightly Established Cause ) .
( One can find something similar also in the Muslim world . )
They are obsessed with , and suffered from , these delusions , and this is the world of Bonno ( earthly desires ) .
Hence , Jodo is the Buddha-land .

Listed below are some other common names for Gokuraku .
And even now , he preaches for people in this Gokuraku .
This thought is mainly believed in the Kegon and Zen sects .
Original Text : If , when become a Buddha , there should be either hell , or the animal state of existence , or the realm of hungry ghosts in my Buddha-land , may I not attain perfect enlightenment .

Examinations are conducted on the following items :
should not be detected .
Amount of consumption of permanganic acid potassium salt
should not be detected .
should not be detected .
Water which is used for sake during the brewing process as an ingredient
Also water that is absorbed in rice before preparation for brewing .
Water that is used for cleaning bottles
It is transformed into sake after brewing .
Koji converts rice starch into glucose , and carries out saccharification .
In case of sake , rice koji plays such role .
Those degrading enzymes carry out saccharification .
Same as with yeasts , there are " lactic acid bacteria for brewing " by the Brewing Society of Japan .
Acids including lactic acid gives " koshi " to sake .
In sake brewing , it is important to appropriately produce acids .
Items which are classified officially as auxiliary materials
( Items to be denoted on the label )
In certain cases , distilled alcohol is added just to increase the volume ( three-time increased sake ) .
If too much activated charcoal is used , the taste of sake becomes thin .
Filter aid
Sake is brewed through the following stages during the process .
The ratio of scraping is denoted as the rice-polishing ratio .
Moisture evaporated by heat caused by friction is restored .
It is manual work that is carried out in the coldest part of the year .
After soaking , rice is spread to maintain humidity .
After sprinkling , rice is gathered in the center forming a big bun-like shape and wrap with a cloth .
" Shimaishigoto " ( literally , " final work " ) - In order to further disperse heat , rice is spread and its temperature is lowered .
As it is carried out when the temperature reaches the maximum ( " saiko " in Japanese ) , it is called saiko tsumikae .
By adding steamed rice to the above-mentioned interim product , the preparation of sake mash-making is complete .
It takes approximately one month until sake mash is obtained .
The time required is approximately two weeks .
Most sake produced today is sokujo-kei .
In preparation , steamed rice and koji are added in three steps .
Among such organic acids , volatile ones compose unique ginjoko .
Mizuawa ( literally , watery foam ) : After two days approx. from sujiawa
White foam that looks like foam ejected from a crab 's mouth .
As a chemical process , it is a situation whereby fermentation has caught up saccharification .
In more detail , it is classified into large tamaawa - > middle tamaawa - > small tamaawa .
Foam forms the shape of a ball and become smaller and smaller .
Tamaawa becomes the smallest and , then , disappears .
It has the following purposes .
If alcohol is added at this stage , the flavor can be adjusted .
The sour taste is suppressed by adding alcohol and the taste becomes more mellow .
In the language of toji and other workers in the brewery , it is also called " shibori " or " agefune . "
The solids are transformed into sakekasu ( sake lees ) .
Powdered active charcoal is called simply " sumi " ( charcoal ) in the brewery .
Method using a cartridge type filter .
If hiochi bacteria are left as they are , sake will become clouded ( hiochi ) .
However , almost all of following images that are generally common are wrong .
Namazake gives the taste of new sake which has been just squeezed and can be enjoyed in the brewery .
In languages of toji and other workers in breweries , " atonama "
Namazake : No first and second hiire conducted
However , with respect to this detailed theory , there are many unsolved questions .
The purpose of this operation is to decrease the alcohol concentration of sake .
Miyamizu jikomi ( preparation using miyamizu )
Kioke jikomi or kioke zukuri ( preparation using a wooden bucket )
Yumai zukuri ( brewing with dissolved rice )
Himeii zukuri ( brewing with deeply steamed soft rice )

( For more information refer to the section " Junmaishu . " )
Seishu other than sake with a specific class name
Most types of sake distributed generally are futsushu .
They are produced by fermenting at low temperature spending a long time .
Generally speaking , it has a gentler fragrance and deeper flavor compared to other daiginjoshu .
( Refer to " Birth of Ginjoshu . )
If sake is produced in a single production facility , the facility may be denoted .
There is no uniform standard for the number of years and terms .
Raw stored sake
Junmaishu brewed in a single brewery
The portion that comes out last during joso .
In particular , in the case of funeshibori , the portion that comes out when squeezed
Nigorizake or origarami
Raw materials , manufacturing method , etc. are restricted so that features of the area are fully used .
The unit " koku " is mainly used to show the production volume of the brewery .
Casks became a mean to transport sake since the Azuchimomoyama period .
Therefore , it was calculated as 70 sho .
For example , we can find an expression like " after three kon of the drinking party . "
By back calculating this formula , the following formula is obtained .
Amakarado is a value that represents the degree of sweetness / dryness of sake .
It is calculated from the concentration of glucose sugar and acid level as follows :
Notando is a value that represents the degree of depth of flavor of sake .
The value is equal to the number obtained by the sodium hydrate titration of the latter .
Generally speaking , if the value is large the flavor of sake is deep and if it is small , the flavor is tanrei ( crispy and dry ) .
Depending upon the composition of such constituents , a large variety of umami are created .
If it is too high , however , the taste becomes dull .
In contrast , if he wants to make sake taste heavy , he uses a longer time for this process .
True dry sake cannot be produced only with alcohol content .
Originally , " 端麗 " is correct as a Japanese word .
It means strong taste .
Nojun is in the opposite end of " tanrei . "
If aftertaste is refreshing and light , it is expressed as " Kire ga aru ( It has sharpness ) . "
In most cases , it disappears in line with the maturity of sake .
If sake gives a good ajikire , the sake is of " shikkari " brewing .
If sake is heated too much , however , it become tasteless .

Shinshubana ( literally , flower of fresh sake )
Smell of alcohol
We will make no errors if we consider that " namazake is milk from rice . "
They say that it is similar to a smell which is felt when Japanese paper is made wet with water .
Sumishu ( smell of charcoal )
Sanpaishu ( oxidative rancidity )
Smell of sakabukuro ( literally , bag for sake ) used for squeezing moromi lingered into sake
It can be prevented by wrapping the bottle with newspaper , etc .
Fragrance that is sensed before putting sake into the mouth coming from the surface of sake to the nose
Fragrance that , after drinking sake , comes up from stomach to the nose
Such sake is expressed as sake that does " kanbae . "
( Refer to " Slumped Period of Sake Consumption . " )
Sakazuki ( sake cup )
Even today , tokkuri is used for pouring sake .
During and before the Edo period , the color of used tokkuri was different in Kamigata ( Kansai District ) and Edo .
In Kamigata , brown earthenware tokkuri that can contained five go ( 900 milliliters ) or one sho ( 1.8 liters ) was used .
In Edo , gray earthenware or kegs with a handle was used .

July 10 is designated as ' Natto no Hi ' ( day of natto ) .
If it is kept at the appropriate temperature , the bacillus subtilis natto increases and fermentation will occur .
Sundry bacteria can proliferate quite easily especially in the case of boiled soybean before the increase of bacillus subtilis natto .
The popularization of foamed polystyrene containers has helped achieve a dramatic increase in the consumption of natto .
In 2008 , Mizkan launched products packed in an improved type of foamed polystyrene .
They were not used independently but together as seasoning agents .
It is also called oboro natto or shoboro natto .
it is served as a snack on the international flights of Japan Air Lines .
A local dish in certain parts of Kochi Prefecture
There is a natto manufacturing company that operates on a national basis ( e.g. Marumiya ) .
In the following regions , soybean-based fermented foods similar to natto are sold .
Tofu is a food that 's made mainly from soybeans .
There several theories regarding its origin , but none of them is definitive .
Soybeans , which are softened by being soaked in water , are mashed together with water and then boiled .
First , soybeans as raw materials are soaked in fresh water overnight ( approximately 12 hours ) .
The concentration of solid soybean was considered to be approximately seven to eight percent .
On the other hand , tofu made without using an antifoaming agent has also received attention .
In broad terms , the soy milk becomes pudding-like , and ultimately it becomes tofu .
The resultant tofu isn 't soaked in water because it 's hard enough .

Okonomiyaki refers to one of the foods grilled on an iron plate .
A moderate amounts of hen 's eggs and grated Japanese yam are added to the dough .
Put many slices of pork on it , aligning them neatly .
If squid is included instead of pork , it is called ' ikatama ' ( savoury pancake with squid ) .
Nowadays , mayonnaise is put on it .
To mix Coke ( drink ) into the dough makes it fluffy .
The composition and the way of mixing the dough are not appropriate .
We can point out the above two examples
It is important and makes the texture better when grilled .
This ingredient is second only to cabbage in terms of the amount used .
Many people feel they are missing something if it is not put in .
Temperature for grilling
The ideal temperature of the iron plate is about 180 ℃ .
To do this , we can expect the effect of fire power to the full .
Once okonomiyaki is formed to some degree , stick a chopstick into it and check the dough .
If the dough is not thick , it is time to eat .
In 1950 , okonomiyaki in those days was similar to negiyaki .
In those days , the price of the vegetables only was about 250 yen .
After coating this dish thinly with sauce , okonomiyaki was put on it .
And it became the present Hiroshimafu-okonomiyaki around 1955 .
If you add yamaimo , following Kansai-style , the dough is likely to break .
Shape it slightly from above with an instrument such as a large spatula and drain the vegetables of some of its juice .
Opinion is divided about pressing it when grilled up .
On the other hand , the reason why pressing is preferred lies in the problem concerning efficiency for the shops .
Naturally it is grilled up earlier when pressed .
Usually Japanese leeks ( edible plant , Allium bakeri , Allium Chinese ) are not included .
It is also called Mix-Double .
In Hiroshima Prefecture , you can order take out and it is put in the styrol box .
Then you have to pay about 50 yen extra , the cost of the container .
In Sendai City or Yamagata City , dondon-yaki is eaten .
Around Tsukishima around 1960 , there were about five monjayaki shops .
The sauce , coal tar-like and sticky , is used .
One that winds okonomiyaki around a chopstick .
In South Korea , there is food called " jijimgae , " similar to okonomiyaki .

Since 1989 , the lottery has been part of the New Year 's postcard stamp as well .
It 's common to try to complete the delivery during the morning .
Nengajo can be created in the following ways :
Using a technique of aburidashi ( invisible writing revealed by applying heat ) using fresh juice of mikan ( tangerine , satsuma ) , etc .

An attempt to reduce costs
Ekiben delicatessens are mainly divided into two groups .
For instance , Shioso Co . , Ltd. has the capability of supplying up to 25,000 box lunches a day .

Therefore , it can be said those lunch box have less variety than Ekiben in Japan .
Passengers had time to buy or eat snacks at a station during a stop .
Similar to Shunbun ( the spring equinox ) , Shubun is where day and night are of similar length .
However , in actual fact , daytime is longer than the night .
Also , there is the equinoctial day of Higan ( equinoctial week ) .

Usually they are not cooked or processed , but eaten after pickling in brine or soya sauce .
Salmon eggs are called ' red ikra ' in Russian .
Fishing begins in earnest in the pacific side of northern Japan and also in Niigata in November .
Eggs harvested at this time are not only difficult to process but even to freeze .
By November the eggs are even more mature .
During manufacture , the roe must not come into contact with fresh water .
The egg membrane will harden in fresh water so sea water or water even saltier than sea water is used .
It 's also called a hoshiuta ( song by a Buddhist priest ) because it was written and taught by people who were blind .
It was also played in Edo until the Genroku era .
However , in Tokyo it has a strong image as an accompaniment to ' kamigatamai ' ( dance developed in Kyoto and Osaka ) in Tokyo .
Jiuta is considered to have started at nearly the same time as the introduction of shamisen .
Therefore , among shamisen music it has the longest history .
Kengyo ( the highest title of official rank within the Todo-za ) Ishimura , in particular , is said to be the patriarch of the rise of shamisen music .
It seems that this was started by the kengyo in Edo .
Later , songs were written in the area of Kyoto and Osaka .
In addition , many pieces that weren 't included in these categories were composed .
Hauta included music for the masses , including some popular songs .
Generally , many of the pieces tend to be lyrical .
Collectively , they are called sankyoku .
Therefore , at the beginning the different instruments weren 't played together in ensembles .
In such an environment , jiuta developed as sangen music .
Thus jiuta evolved to have a strong instrumental aspect .
Ensembles of shamisen also became popular .
Later , the mainstream composition of tegotomono moved to Kyoto .
Furthermore , Kengyo Kikuoka ( 1792 - 1847 ) wrote many tegotomono pieces in Kyoto .
Jiuta music had already been perfected .
Furthermore , Todo-za was disbanded by the new government .
However , jiuta spread to the general public this way .
Many pieces were written by blind composers .
Moreover , they have developed as pure music independent of theater .
Many few pieces use up to three octaves , particularly the ' tegotomono ' numbers .
Examples of tuning
Key of C - ichi sagari ( san agari ) - honchoshi , in " Sakuragawa , " for example .
The range usually covers two octaves .
They gradually became one , and by the latter half of the Edo period they became inseparable .
Furthermore , jiuta shamisen can also be used as an accompaniment to kokyuhonkyoku .
Accordingly , a single piece can be listed under various groupings .
There are categories that aren 't necessarily used in every school .
Handayumono ( pieces that came from Handayu Bushi of joruri )
Shugimono ( a group of festive musical pieces composed for celebrations such as weddings )
Those that are based on the places where they were composed
Kyomono ( tegotomono composed in Kyoto )
Nagoyamono ( a group of musical pieces composed by Kengyo Yoshizawa and those who belonged to his school )
Miyagikyoku ( a group of works composed by Michio MIYAGI )
Shibaiuta ( a group of songs that are used as accompaniments to theatrical plays )
These arise from the musical characteristics of jiuta .
Yamada school sokyoku is based around the songs of icchubushi ( a particular type of joruri style ) and other songs of the joruri style .
This music is called ' new Japanese music . '
The addition of picks to three fingers on the right hand remains unchanged .

This is different from the previously mentioned ' yakinuki kamaboko ' ( roasted kamaboko ) .
Kezuri kamaboko ( scraped kamaboko )
This type of kamaboko is eaten in the south Iyo region around Yawatahama City .
It used to be made by rolling the paste around the bamboo stick in a tubular form .

He simultaneously prepared for conflict by fortifying the barriers and checkpoints in the neighboring provinces .
This unjust Imperial decree is due to the slanders of disloyal retainers .
Progress of the war
Because the forces had been assembled so hastily , the army that departed from Kamakura along the Tokaido initially consisted of only 18 horsemen .
But if he is not personally in command , fight with all your might . '

Conflict begins between Yoshimitsu and Yoshihiro
Trapped into a corner , Yoshihiro made a secret alliance with Mitsukane ASHIKAGA , the kubo ( official in charge ) of the Kanto region .
Hiroshige OUCHI , his younger brother , asserted that he obey Yoshimitsu 's will and go to Kyoto .
Yoshihiro met with Chushin ZEKKAI .
Chushin ZEKKAI gave up his attempts to persuade Yoshihiro otherwise and returned to the capital .
Yoshihiro called a meeting with his advisors where they discussed military strategy .
Yoshihiro adopted Bizen Nyudo 's defensive strategy of entrenching themselves in their castles .
All of Yoshihiro 's followers had also prepared to die in battle .
The Ouchi forces fought back , raining arrows down on the enemy from their watchtowers .
Yoshihiro also led 200 riders over to join the fight .
He cut his way into the battle lines of the shogunal army on the north side of the city , striking left and right with his katana in fierce fighting .
At that moment , the 200 soldiers from Iwami Province defected and joined the shogunal force .
Thereafter , he abandoned political life and immersed himself in the composing of waka ( classical Japanese poems ) and renga ( linked verse ) .
To Hiroshige , who had capitulated , he granted only the provinces of Suo and Nagato .
Morimi then extended his military hegemony even further , gaining control as far as Aki and Iwami Provinces .
The most famous person that Fushimi recruited was Tamekane KYOGOKU .
On this occasion the bakufu took strong measures .
The person who filled the gap in power was Godaigo , who was still in Hoki .
There was also the circumstance that Otomo supported Saga in the conflict with Heizei .
In the end , Morihira was named Crown Prince in 967 .
This in fact shortened the period until the abdication of Reizei .
This was a compromise that had large benefits to both sides .
By becoming a priest , Kazan was automatically considered to have abdicated .

There is nothing more tragic than the battles at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate
100 hundred years have since passed .
The situation fell into a further state of confusion .
There shall be no granting of private dominion over land apart from an imperial order . '
In order to ensure his reforms would come to fruition , Shinzei created the Kirokusho ( Records Office for Shoen Land Deeds ) .
In order to ensure he could continue to make progress with his political reforms , Shinzei befriended TAIRA no Kiyomori .
At this point in time there was , however , one more political colossus that could not be ignored .
In this climate , Goshirakawa selected FUJIWARA no Nobuyori , governor of Musashi Province , to promote and groom as a retainer .
Narichika , owing to the fact that he was the brother of Shigemori 's wife , was specially granted clemency .
The heads of Yoshitomo and Masaie were put on display at the prison gate in Kyoto on February 24 , 1160 .

There are 190 volumes .
It was FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu who first created the basis for the regency .
This achievement became a foothold for the rise of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan in the following generation .
Some time later this movement resulted in the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate and military rule .
This incident brought the notable Tomo clan ( the Otomo clan ) , which had lasted since ancient times , to ruin .
This is considered to be one of the affairs in which exclusionary practices were used against other clans by the Fujiwara clan .
The Imperial Court was in an uproar , and many people performed incantations and prayers .

At the same time , Nobuyoshi TAKEDA of the Kai-Genji ( Minamoto clan ) had raised forces in Kanto as well .
The forces of Yoshinaka reached Kyoto .
After a fierce battle , the Taira clan forces were forced to retreat to the sea ( The Battle of Ichinotani ) .
The Taira clan ended with this battle .
As a result , it led to the establishment of the Kamakura bakufu .
The phenomenon of Minamoto clan members fighting each other or Taira clan members fighting each other was seen across the country .
They expanded their power in Kyoto over approximately 5 years .
They did so through acts such as refusing the delivery of Jishisen ( the land taxes paid by tenant farmers . )
Six years after this , the Nichiren sect became a prohibited religion in Kyoto .
The news of the capital 's relocation greatly disturbed the public .
Emperor Saga was determined to reject the relocation of the capital .
Emperor Saga promoted SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro , who was a zogushi , to Dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) .
Nakanari was shot and killed that night by an archer .
In fact , Kuwajiro OISHI was killed for Ryoma 's assassination .

The portrait of Retired Emperor Gotoba
A list of famous people in the Kamakura period
There was an article charging the three Ashikaga shoguns with being Gyakuzoku rebels .
At that time , Shirakawa owned little property as a Retired Emperor and had almost no forces in his name .
Emperor Nijo died in 1165 .
From this point onwards , the military color of the Taira clan administration became more prominent .
This quieted down the rebellions around Kinai .
The Taira clan became unable to do anything but lose repeatedly and eventually died out .
( e.g. Ryoke shiki , Soji shiki , Goshi shiki , etc . )
The feudal government had the authority to assign Jito in Kanto goseibaichi ( provinces , manors and provincial lands where the shogun families of Kamakura bakufu possess the power to appoint / dismiss Jito ) .

Later he established the Muromachi bakufu .
They are also called Enko-ji ban .
In 1606 Genkitsu published the " Bukei-shichisho " ( seven classical strategy books of China ) .
One of the territories was Tanabe-jo Castle in Tango , the lord of which was Tadaoki HOSOKAWA .
Therefore , they were hesitant to capture Tanabe-jo Castle .
At the same time , Emperor Goyozei of the Court was afraid that Yusai would die in battle .
It was significant that 15,000 soldiers were unable to make it to the main part of the Battle of Sekigahara .

According to the prevailing view , it was 1573 in which Nobunaga ODA ousted the then present shogun , Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA .
This is called gekokujo ( an inverted social order when the lowly reigned over the elite ) .
Even after the Disturbance , the power of the bakufu as the central government remained .
Those who developed power and became independent are called sengoku daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku Period ) .
As Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA died in 1511 , Sumimoto 's side became inferior in power .
Kataharu YANAGIMOTO conquered the area around Kyo .
( For information on the government by the Miyoshi clan commenced from Nagayoshi MIYOSHIA , refer to " Sakaikubo " ( the municipal government based in Sakai City ) .
Nobunaga ODA defeated all of such opponents .
Some of them were from kokushi ( provincial governors ) ( Kitabatake clan ) and nobles ( Tosa Ichijo clan ) .
By region
In every country , how to handle this power was a big problem .
After killing Yoshimoto IMAGAWA in war at Okehazama , Nobunaga made an alliance with the Matsudaira clan in Mikawa .
However , it seems that they could not conduct complete control in each country .
In the early stage , there was conflict between Yoshioki OUCHI and Tsunehisa AMAKO .
The Hosokawa clan governed Awa .
In the Sengoku Period , the Shozui-jo Castle was the base for governing Awa .
Later , because of the Conquest of Shikoku by Hideyoshi , the Chosokabe clan was confined to one country , Tosa .
Yoshishige OTOMO protected Christianity and promoted trade with Spain and Portugal .
Also , it contains an idea that the existence of stone walls is supreme .
On the other hand , Christianity that came from abroad started to also expand .
Before the sixth century , each gozoku ( local ruling family ) directly governed the land and the people .
For this reason , shoki shoen declined until the tenth century .
It is called kokumen sho ( a shoen allowed exemption from so or other tribute in the benpo or binho system ) .
The farmland on which the taxation was imposed was divided into the unit called myoden ( rice field lots in charge of a nominal holder ) .
Especially in the Kinai region , the rice-field donation to dominant temples and shrines became active .
These tatos are included in kaihatsu-ryoshu ( local notables who actually developed the land ) .
This became the landmark which led to the start of cloister government .
( Tsukuda was also called gosaku or shosaku . )
Like this , great power and authority were given to shugos .
Shugos established the territorial governance of the whole of one province .
Shugos during the Muromachi period were called shugo-daimyo .
The Ming dynasty put the imperial manors which were directly managed by the imperial court in different parts of the country .
The lords of shoens also held trials based on common law or regional customs .
Prior to the appearance of shoens , two land systems existed .
See the details in the section on the serf system .
Shoens showed wide varieties in the sense of geographical situations .
This situation continued until the independence of India after the World War II .
Major examples of military aristocrats are Kanmu-Heishi ( Taira clan ) , Seiwa-Genji ( Minamoto clan ) , and the Fujiwara clan of the Hidesato line .
Posts of Military Aristocrats in the Government
Needless to say , military aristocrats were required to contribute to the Imperial Court in military affairs .
He was at that point far beyond what military aristocrats could normally achieve .
Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI began the land survey in 1582 .
In accordance with Taiko-kenchi , Kokudaka ( crop yield ) for each province was defined .
The Sashidashi-kenchi ( or the Shincho-kenchi ) is said to be the model for the Taiko-kenchi .
History of studies
Some do not even record this .
In most tsuchi-ikki , they appealed to the government to enforce tokusei ( which literally means " virtuous rule , " representing cancellations of debts in this case ) .
That is why Tsuchi-ikki is sometimes called Tokusei ikki .
Accordingly , the bakufu initially issued orders to forbid tokusei .

The edict was made from Chinese literature .
The contents of a funeral are specifically stated in the last half .
This is to make the size of a traditional grave smaller and simplified .
The biggest Kofun in Goguryeo is Daioryo in Shuan City , China .
In addition , kofun are continuously destroyed .
Toro Ruins and Karako-Kagi Site are such examples .

Backgrounds of the battle
Details of the battle
In this way , the battle was a fierce one where many soldiers on either side died .
In letters written after the battle , both sides claimed victory .
Anyway , it was not clear which side won nor which side lost in the battle .
The data here depends on " Koyo Gunkan " and others .
Therefore , no more big battle was fought in Kawanakajima .
Therefore , it can be said that the Takeda clan won the battle strategically .
In November ( in the old calendar ) of the same year , Shingen stormed Suruga Province , breaking the ally relationship with the Imagawa clan .
Before long , both sides became to have the common enemy named Nobunaga ODA .
The data is based on the visual information of Tenkai , a priest and an adviser to the bakufu in the Edo period , and on others .
Therefore , it is said that use of caution is necessary in citing the strategy .
It has not been determined whether the description was true or not .
Before Yomei-gaku
Shushigaku and Yomeigaku were the leading schools of this movement .

Reinterpretation of " The Great Learning "
The major differences in interpretation between Yomei-gaku and Shushi-gaku are described below .

2 . Meaning of ' Great Learning '
On the other hand , Wang Yangming simply read ' qinmin ' as meaning ' to be affectionate to the people . '
In short , he reinterpreted the word as rectifying the incorrect mind .
Yomei-gaku 's Innovations
Subsequent Development of Yomeigaku
Accordingly , they asserted that action based on them was also free from good and evil .
This is called the ' Theory of Four Forms of Non-Existence " .
Li Zhuowu was the last of the left-wingers of Yomeigaku .
At first , Li advocated the " Theory of the Child 's Mind " ( " tongxin shuo " in Chinese , " doshin setsu " in Japanease ) by reforming the theory of ryochi .
This became the beginning of the Qing period Koshogaku and the study of Keiseichiyo .
Yomeigaku at the end of the Qing Dynasty
The depressed state of Yomeigaku gradually changed after the Opium War of 1840 .
Liang Qichao was influenced by this trend .

Nakamaro was strongly favored by Empress Koken and rapidly gained power .
According to his will , Funado no Okimi ( Prince Funado ) became the Crown Prince .
Azumahito insisted his innocence .
Azumahito and others changed their attitude and confessed about the rebellion .
However , his fall came quickly after Empress Koken 's love moved to Dokyo .

In the ship Tadamitsu and all who went with him cut hair and showed their determination .
On September 29 , Tenchu-gumi entered Kawachi Hinozan Kanshin-ji Temple .
Having besieged the office , Tenchu-gumi called for surrender to the magistrate Gennai SUZUKI .
The supporters of the bakufu came to have real power in the Imperial Court .
Tenchu-gumi , that flew into a rage with this change of attitude , decided to attack Takatori-jo Castle .
The Takatori Domain , that sensed departure of Tenchu-gumi , strengthened the defense .
Finally Tadamitsu , who was at a loss , commanded the dissolution of Tenchu-gumi on October 31 .

However , as for minor offences , each government official had jurisdiction independently .
The following is the composition of the personnel equivalent to or lower than Taifu ( Senior Assistant Minister ) .

It was to cultivate the law-abiding spirit of general public to the acts and laws
Those could have been the actual reasons of the discontinuation of Kosatsu system .
This new Ritsuryo code is Yoro Ritsuryo Code .
The Yoro Ritsuryo Code book itself does not exist , as it has been scattered and lost .
Ritsu represents the penal code in the modern age .

Kazumasa and Nobuyasu were familiar with each other . '
So Kazumasa fled to Hideyoshi to seek a new master . '
However , in 1613 , both lords were deprived of their domains .
It is commonly believed that the punishment of the ISHIKAWA clan was due to the their involvement in the Nagayo OKUBO incident .
The second lord of the domain , Masayuki KOBORI , allocated 1,000 koku to his younger brother .
Here is the abolition of the Omi Komuro Domain .
The gate of jinya was relocated and exists today .
Sai is a unit of volume ( capacity ) in old Japanese system of weights and measures .
In this case , 1 sai is set at 1.8039 milliliter .
That was because Emperor Komei supported the policy of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
It was an extension of this to display living residents of their colony .
This triggered the incident .
Some fierce protests came from Qing in the same manner .
Following this , UEHARA unilaterally resigned as Ministry of Army .
Yukio OZAKI explained the reason why they submitted a non-confidence motion as follows :
Thereby the Seiyukai Party lost its leadership in the campaign to oust the KIYOURA cabinet .
Also , the war was a remote cause of the Hongan-ji Temple power split in the Edo period .
It is simply referred to as " Hongan-ji Temple " in the following sentences .
Then , Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple flourished as a headquarters of Hongan-ji Temple .
Helplessly , Nobunaga made the soldiers withdraw while strengthening the three-side surveillance .
Now Hongan-ji Temple was isolated under complete siege .

Private bills eventually led to the creation of han bills .
The credibility of han bills was also at risk whenever the financial situation of the domain worsened .
The Meiji government issued the Order of Withdrawing Han Bills when Haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) was introduced in 1871 .

There are many modern novelists who have gained inspiration from " The Collection of Tales of Times Now Past . "
If it is true , the essay would be the oldest account concerning the tale .
The influences exerted on " Heiji Monogatari " and " Heike Monogatari " are most controversial .
The tale starts with a description of the reign of the Cloistered Emperor Toba .
However , there are signs of decline in the Emperor 's reign .
First , his son Emperor Konoe passes away before him .
Because of this , Sutoku feels vexation .
Both of them begin to gather warriors and warrior-monks who will side with them .
Both camps begin to gather powerful warriors in preparation for an armed conflict .
Tametomo alone is disappointed to hear this .

Prince Shigehito , who has learned of the loss of his father , goes to Ninna-ji Temple and becomes a priest .
The country has never been pacified , as Sutoku had hoped .
Thus the prediction of Otowaka , who was killed by Yoshitomo , has come to pass .
Moreover , he sails to Oniga-shima Island and subdues even the inhabitants there .
Meanwhile , there is little reference to Tametomo in historical materials .
This is why " Hogen Monogatari " is said to have a sympathetic viewpoint toward the father and the son .

In 1853 , Ieyoshi died of an illness following the arrival of the Black Ships .

History of transportation
Development of post-station towns
To promote traffic network , the construction of railways was given priority over that of roads .
After this , railway construction was promoted by both the private and public sectors .
This is the Watkins Report issued in 1956 .
At the same time , the improvement of airports was promoted as well , and thus the size of air transportation gradually increased .
Current transportation in Japan
Therefore , there are some railways which have discontinued , especially in rural areas .
On the other hand , however , no hub airport has been constructed yet in Japan .
Many station lavatories have also improved to include multipurpose toilets .
There are also some trains having multipurpose toilets .
Railways in Japan could never have maintained punctuality without their ingenious attempts and efforts .
Incidentally , the share of freight transportation has been remaining low level under 5 % .
In exceptional cases , the fare may be predetermined regardless of the distance or the time .
After the passengers get out of the taxi , the door closes mechanically , so customers need not close it .
The fare of general taxis consists of the following items .
A fare determined by how long the passenger has used the taxi .
Fare which is predetermined regardless of the distance or time .
This system can be sometimes seen in private companies that have regular patrons .
Usually 20 to 30 % of the regular fare is added .
Usually 20 % of the regular fare is added .
Discount for long-distance travel
When a passenger uses a taxis over a certain distance , a certain amount of fare is discounted .
Note that this classification differs from that of the Road Traffic Act .
A full-size car is an ordinary motor vehicle ( with a license plate whose number starts from 3 ) with a riding capacity of six people or less .
Some small wagons such as Nissan cube and TOYOTA Fun Cargo are often included in this class .
A charge required when customers call for a taxi
A charge added on while the taxi is waiting for the customer for his / her own convenience
In a part of Kansai area , PiTaPa Cards are available .
There are two types of share-ride taxi services .
These services are cheaper than taking a taxi to the airport individually .
However , female drivers tend to work in the daytime .
In case that the driver is asked to bear a special burden regarding the transportation by the passenger .
In the event that the passenger is a critically ill person without any escort .
( 6 ) In case that the driver has a fair reason defined by the Ordinances of the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism
( 1 ) A passenger who has explosives or other dangerous objects
Fireworks for personal use , that weigh more than 100 grams
Issue of ' rejection of boarding ' of taxis
A machine used for payment by credit card
In recent years , some taxi companies use tachographs with a memory card ( digital ) system .
Taxis usually use the frequency band of 400MHz .
More and more taxi companies are installing one these days , especially in large cities .

Series 300 Shinkansen train-cars and 0 series Shinkansen train-cars
For electric power , a single-phase 25,000 AC is supplied to the train-cars .
The following frequency commercial power supplies are used :
60 Hz is used throughout the Tokaido Shinkansen line .
The train-cars on the Shinkansen line support both 50-Hz power supplies and 60-Hz power supplies as well .
An air section is provided for switching power supplies .
Therefore , use of the distributed traction system is more advantageous in laying and maintaining rails than that of the concentrated traction system .
However , there are many theories concerning this matter .
Such a line indicates railway lines that were originally for transporting deadheads on a Shinkansen line but have become used for passenger transportation as well .
Therefore , new railways for Shinkansen will be laid for this section .
The Hokuriku Shinkansen line : between Kanazawa Station and Fukui Station ( the work to reform Tsuruga Station is included )
After this , the basic plan became ineffective corresponding to the privatization of JNR in 1987 .
In the past , the nickname of " West Hikari " and that of " Grand-Hikari " also existed .
Asama ' : the trains connecting Tokyo Station to Nagano Station .
The maximum speed remained at 100 km / h or less from the 1910s to 1950s .
However , the railways in Europe and the United States at that time advanced further .
The technologies developed in Mantetsu were never used effectively for the railways in main land of Japan .
It is said that the term of ' Shinkansen ' originated here .
In 1951 , Shima left JNR due to some reasons .
However , use of AC power came to be applied to the electric system of Shinkansen later .
When trains are operated in a super-high speed on an electric railway line , lots of power is consumed .
New railways should be laid along the existing railways , making the railways a four-track line .
New narrow gauge railways should be laid through a new route .
New broad gauge railways should be laid through a new route .
After this , the railway share of the traffic in the Tohoku and Joetsu regions increased considerably .
This fact is sometimes called the safety myth of the Shinkansen .
This was the first derailment accident during operation in Shinkansen history .
In the case of the Toki 325 train , it was lucky that no train was running on the track on the other side .
It planned to increase the speed of TGV to 360 km / h .
1981 : In France , operation of TGV started between Paris and Lyon .
1983 : In France , 270 km / h was achieved with TGV .
1990 : 275 km / h was achieved on the Joetsu Shinkansen line ( using a downward slope in the Shimizu tunnel ) .
2007 : In France , 320 km / h was achieved with TGV .
In the United States , there is a plan to construct a high-speed railway line between Los Angeles and San Francisco of California .
JR Tokai has promoted selling the Shinkansen system for the route actively .
Therefore , for these lines , the limited express fees are dealt with as follows :
In this way , the system is so complex .
For more information , refer to the Kyushu Shinkansen line in the connected ride fee system .
In long-distance transportation services , competition with airline companies continued .
Competition with limited expresses of private railway companies
Competition with limited expresses of Kintetsu Railway
A direct competition is found between Nagoya and Osaka .
The competition started when the Tokaido Shinkansen line started operation in 1964 .
Details of the historical aspect described above are described in the history of Kintetsu limited expresses .
Competition with Odakyu Romance Car trains
The section between Kokura and Hakata of the Sanyo Shinkansen line constitutes such a case .
It might be said that harmonious operations are achieved there .
A place named ' Shinkansen ' exists in Kannami Town , Takada-gun , Shizuoka Prefecture .

It is one of the few large scale natural forests still remaining in the Kinki region .
Also , even today , the old name of Ashiu forest for field practice is still commonly used .
Topographically , the altitude is high since the research forest is located in the east-end area of the Tanba highland .
Precipitous cliffs or falls are formed in areas where chert dominates .
However , the boundary between these areas is unclear .
Japanese Cherry Birch , hornbeam and spice bush grow mostly in the secondary forests .
The fauna in this research forest is as diverse as the flora .
There are some species that were newly found in Ashiu .
Major forest roads were provided so that cars could run on them .
Only the roadbeds were completed initially .
The improved sections were extended to more and more remote areas .
This way of using the forest changed gradually after the middle of the Meiji period .
In 1952 , the supply of the electric power to local residents started .
In 1961 , power supply by Kansai Electric Power Co . , Inc. started .
The expansion of these forest roads resulted in increasing the forest area where trees were logged .
It also started the direct sale of standing timber within large areas in 1955 .
However , such reforestation could not catch up to the expansion in logging areas .
The company also developed thermal power plants in coastal areas of the metropolitan region .
Each of these plans was presented to persons concerned with Kansai Electric Power .
In particular , Kyoto Imperial University at that time was behind other universities in opening domestic forest for field practice .
Therefore , the number of persons entering this forest from this side has increased .
If no measures are taken against this problem , the vegetation will be badly affected .
However , with no effective measure existing , it is a difficult problem for which a solution can not be found easily ..

The Shakaku System Based on the Engi-shiki

It began in the provinces in the late Heian period , and was eventually established in the Kinai area too .
Kokunai Jimmyo-cho is a list of the shrines that the Kokushi visited when he made his pilgrimage .
In addition to the Modern Times Shakaku System above , the following system was established .
This is referred to as the " hollow structure " of Japanese mythology .
Some say that Tsukuyomi was ordered to rule Yomi ( the world after death ) where Izanami no kami had lived .
Tsukutsumi no mikoto , the son ( or daughter ) of Izanagi no mikoto , sat here .
Additionally , in Manyoshu ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) there are poems that connect Tsukihito ( moon person ) and the Japanese Judas tree .
夜見 ( " yomi " ) of 月夜見 ( " Tsuki yomi " ) : spelled ヨ甲 ( " yo " ) ・ ミ甲 ( ' mi ' )
ヨ乙 : used in 月読 ( ' tsukuyomi ' ) and " 月余美 " ( ' tsukiyomi ' )
ヨ甲 : used in 月夜見 ( " Tsukiyomi " )
The name of the god ( Tsukuyomi ) allows for several theories about where it comes from .
Shrines that worship Tsukuyomi
There are two types of shrines that worship Tsukuyomi .
" Tsuki to honoo no senki ( The War Chronicle of the Battle Between the Moon and Fire ) , " by Hiroyuki MORIOKA
" Susanoo " by Haruhiko MASUDA
In archaic Japanese , the miko was cited as 巫 .
( Neither can we say that virginity has not been required at all . )
Rinno-ji Temple ( Nikko City ) ( where a miko wears a green hakama )
It 's a kind of gate .

Torii are counted as i-ki ( one ki of torii ) and ni-ki ( two ki of torii ) .

In recent years , some torii have contained iron pulp or have been made of reinforced concrete .
It stands out in the sea before the temple of Itsukushima Jinja Shrine .
There are 10,000 torii in this shrine .
Its torii was built by Tokuichiro KOBAYASHI ( Kokura , Kitakyushu City ) , a well-known devotee of dedications .
But the leading theory is that Komainu has an Indian origin .
These should be primarily called " Shishi " .
This also suggests that Emonfu of the Right placed the statue on the right side of the gate ; all of these signify that the Komainu dates back to the Heian era .
In Shinto , all of these animals are called Shinshi ( the messengers of the god ) .
Some temples or shrines consider Komainu on your right and your left as a couple .
The Chinese characters for Ommyodo can be read " Inyodo " as well .
Some copies say that it was written in 806 .
The postface must have been altered at a later time .
