This idea provides the foundation of Jodo kyo ( Pure Land teachings ) with its belief in Amida .
At present , the phrase " Tariki Hongan " is used for both types of the meanings mentioned above .
Let us look into Ken Jodo Shinjitsu Kyogyosho monrui ( The True Teaching , Practice and Realization of the Pure Land Way ) written by Shinran .
So the priests of the Jodo kyo interpreted Tariki as the work of the Original Vow made by Amida Buddha .
( from the Asahi newspaper , May 28 , 2005 )
" Amida-kyo Sutra " ( Sutra of Amida Buddha ) is one of sutras of Mahayama Buddhism .
Among the existent translations , this is the one that reflects the original most faithfully .
First , it preaches the solemnity of Gokuraku Jodo ( the Land of Perfect Bliss ) , where Amida-Nyorai resides .
He is thought to be the founder of Jodo ( Pure Land ) sect in China .
It is not known when he was born or when he died , but it is thought that he lived from a year in the latter half of the Northern Wei period to the Northern Qi period .
He was the First Patriarch of the Five Patriarchs of Jodo sect , and the Third of the Seven Patriarchs of Jodo shin shu ( True Pure Land Sect Buddhism ) .
Most of all , his theory forms the basis of Shinran 's doctrine .
" San Amida butsu ge " ( Hymns in Praise of Amida Buddha ) is a tribute to Amida tathagata in poetic verse .
Thus he established the doctrine of Jodo sect .
He was the second of the five founders of the Jodo sect and the fourth founder of the seven eminent monks of the Jodo Shinshu ( the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism ) .
He became a monk at 14 years of age and was well-versed in Nehan-gyo Sutra ( The Sutra of The Great Nirvana ) .
Later , he engaged in ascetic practices under the guidance of Esan .
It is said that he repeated nenbutsu ( Buddhist invocation ) 70,000 times each day until his death .
He died on May 27 , 645 at the age of 85 .
Two volumes of " Anrakushu " ( A Collection of Passages Concerning Birth in the Pure Land )
Engi in Buddhism
It is an interpretation shown by Interpretation of the Six Characters of Shandao , as mentioned above .
" Gan " refers to the wishes of those among mankind who believe ' Namu ' and Amida Buddha .
" Gyo " refers to the ascetic practices of Amida Buddha for the salvation of mankind .
" Ho " refers to Honganriki ( power of the original vow ) of Amida Buddha , who saves the mankind ( amidabutsu ) .
Shomyo means the invocation of the name ( s ) of the Buddha and / or Bodhisattva .
This name invoking is a Shojo no go ( a Rightly Established Practice ) in order to be reborn in the Pure Land .
( One can find something similar also in the Muslim world . )
It is also called " Josetsu " , " Jokoku " or " Jokai . "
They are obsessed with , and suffered from , these delusions , and this is the world of Bonno ( earthly desires ) .
As seen from this , the pureness of the world depends on spirituality .
However , although Jodo is the land of Buddha , the land of Buddha is not necessarily Jodo .
In a certain sense , these places conform to Jodo .

And she enshrined Amaterasu Omikami there .
( Also , their terms of service are not so clear . )
Afterward , the dispatch of Saio to Ise was stopped once , following the reign of Emperor Yomei .
However , it was formally established as a system during the period of Emperor Tenmu .
This way , Oku no Himemiko , who was a renowned Manyo Kajin ( a poet of Manyoshu , or The Anthology of Myriad Leaves ) , became the first Saio .
This continued until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts even after the transfer of the capital to Heian-kyo .
And she taboos Buddhism .

Many pieces were written by blind composers .
Many few pieces use up to three octaves , particularly the ' tegotomono ' numbers .

It is a story of the Genroku Ako Incident , a historical fact , depicted within the framework of " Taiheiki . "
The pair have no choice but to elope .
This becomes the direct cause for which Moronao provokes Hangan .
All of the affiliated stories are sewamono ( plays dealing with the lives of ordinary people ) involving love and money .
Alternate name : the scene of Turugaoka Shrine
Alternate name : the scene of Kabuto aratame ( examination of the helmets )
On the left is Sadanji ICHIKAWA the second who wears the costume of Kuranosuke OISHI .

Momonoi-yakata matsukiri no ba ( scene of cutting branches of a pine tree at the Momonoi mansion )
Wakasanosuke confesses that he was so furious that he intended to kill Moronao .
Act Three
Moronao doesn 't appear in this scene .
This is a scene in which the actor playing the role of Bannai , Moronao 's retainer who receives the bribe , can show his skill as an actor .
Kanpei HAYANO , an accompanying samurai of Hangan , elopes with Okaru , a koshimoto of Kaoyo .
It is a delightful and colorful shosagoto ( dance in kabuki ) which is performed in place of " Uramon-gaten . "
It is a program in which the audience can enjoy the light yet gorgeous atmosphere while listening to a refreshing kiyomoto ( a joruri performance ) .

Mt . Fuji is seen in the distance .
The curtain is drawn in the opposite direction ( from stage right to stage left ) .

It is a comfort scene before the scene of seppuku .
Umanojo ISHIDO and Jirozaemon YAKUSHIJI are visits from the shogun family ,
Hangan waits for the arrival of the chief retainer Yuranosuke OBOSHI , but he does not appear .

Kanpei has become a hunter and he is married Okaru .
Kanpei works and earns his income as a hunter in Yamazaki .
They were Kanpei HAYANO and Yagoro SENZAKI , former vassals of Enya Hangan .
There is not much to the story if he delivers the money to Kanpei directly .

The only one that is lucky in Act Five is the inoshishi .
Yoichibei appears from the hanamichi .
As mentioned above , he is carrying money .
Inoshishi disappears to left stage .

This role is regarded as a small role and is normally allotted to a lower-ranking actor .
Danjuro ICHIKAWA ( the ninth ) made a lot of changes in staging .
One of them was Sadakuro 's line when he is counting money .
Kanpei hides his face with an umbrella in the opening scene of " Teppo watashi . "
He removes the umbrella at the signal of a time bell , and his face becomes visible .
It is an excellent staging since Kanpei 's face emerges out of complete darkness .
The play started and the inoshishi appeared from the hanamichi .
It is not something that was constructed in the modern times to attract tourists .
Act Six
Okaru is sold to and taken away by Osai , an okami ( madam ) of Gion , and Genroku .

Kanpei dies while being watched by Okaya , who is weeping , and his comrades .

In Kanto , Kanpei changes his costume to the blue-colored silk one while Osai is conversing with others .
Act Seven
Although his comrades come and persuades him , Yuranosuke ignores them .
He also allows Heiemon to become a member of the comrades .
" Mitate " is done in the first half of the scene where Yuranosuke plays at a chaya ( literally " teahouse " , which refers to the place where geisha entertain their guests ) .
These are played by low- or middle-ranking actors who play the roles of nakai ( waitress ) or hokan ( professional jester ) .
Baiko ONOE ( the sixth ) is said to be the best actor for the role of Okaru .
This implies a change in his state of mind .
Act Eight
Act Nine
Yuranosuke shows a grave , made of snow , for the father and the son , located in the back garden .
Yuranosuke and his son inform Honzo of the strategy to raid Moronao 's residence .
Some words which suggest the actual Ako Incident are used in this section .
It is a thoughtful staging to give audience a break when tension is building in the play .
For that reason , skilled supporting actors play this role .
This role was a signature role of Kichinojo NAKAMURA in the past , and currently , that of Tsurusuke KAGAYA .
Act Ten
Alternate name : Moronao-yashiki uchiiri no ba ( scene of the raid on Moronao 's residence )

Next day , on June 1 , Nobunaga held a tea ceremony party in the Honno-ji Temple .
He fled to Gifu Prefecture through the Azuchi-jo Castle and he was safe .
This view surmises that the cause of the Honnoji Incident was to avoid conquest of Shikoku planned by Nobunaga .
This view has been advocated centering around Professor Tatsuo FUJITA of the Mie University .
( Refer to " Other consideraitons about motive and ringleader . " )
Refer to the view that Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI was the mastermind of Honnnoji Incident .
This story has been often referred to in historical novels .

Because the Joko was called ' In , ' this form of government is referred to as ' insei . '
The Joko who proclaimed insei was also called chiten-no-kimi ( a sovereign who ruled the world ) .
The practice of insei could be seen during the reins of Empress Jito , Empress Gensho , and Emperor Shomu , for example .
This is generally regarded as the start of insei .
Insei in the Edo period
As a result , Edo Bakufu had no choice but to tolerate the existence of insei .
Insei is virtually prohibited in modern Japan .
The word " insei " is also used in modern Japan .
It is often used to describe the status of national government or business management .

They also prepared a petition for lenient treatment of the Aizu and Shonai Domains to the Grand Council of State ( dajokan ) .
Most of the remaining troops in the allied forces fled to Aizu .
It was apparent that the Aizu Domain would lose , and so the overall outcome of the Tohoku War was decided .
In October , the Yonezawa Domain surrendered .
The Aizu Domain , which had been resisting all along , finally surrendered to the new government .

This period is called the ' Koan no tokusei ' ( political reforms in Koan era ) .
The most famous person that Fushimi recruited was Tamekane KYOGOKU .
Ryoto tetsuritsu was now established as a given .
It was difficult to change the succession plan for the Imperial Throne that was determined by Gouda using normal measures .
The first thing that Gofushimi started was the selection of the next Crown Prince .
The person who filled the gap in power was Godaigo , who was still in Hoki .
The name of the era was changed and " the second year of Seikei " became " the third year of Genko . "
Ryoto tetsuritsu during the Heian period

This incident is the " Jowa Incident . "
In the end , Morihira was named Crown Prince in 967 .
This in fact shortened the period until the abdication of Reizei .
This was a compromise that had large benefits to both sides .
Additionally , Michinaga 's daughter , FUJIWARA no Kanshi became Koichijoin 's Nyogo .

In order to ensure his reforms would come to fruition , Shinzei created the Kirokusho ( Records Office for Shoen Land Deeds ) .
At this point in time there was , however , one more political colossus that could not be ignored .
It was at this point that animosity was born between the faction supporting Goshirakawa 's insei ( cloister government ) and the faction for direct Imperial rule by Emperor Nijo .
In this climate , Goshirakawa selected FUJIWARA no Nobuyori , governor of Musashi Province , to promote and groom as a retainer .

Yoshiki 's forces were divided by this news .
After that , shogunal administration was supported by the Hosokawa clan 's power .
It was FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu who first created the basis for the regency .
This achievement became a foothold for the rise of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan in the following generation .
Yoshifusa had two major political techniques .
In 1068 , Emperor Gosanjo acceded to the throne through the trend of integrating the emperor 's successors in the dynasty .
The most conspicuous example was probably Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI 's taking the post of chancellor .
Some time later this movement resulted in the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate and military rule .
However , FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa , the Daijo-daijin ( Grand minister of state ) , provided counsel and Genshin was set free .
This is considered to be one of the affairs in which exclusionary practices were used against other clans by the Fujiwara clan .
It is said Yoshio wanted to become the Udaijin ( minister of the right ) , by bringing down MINAMOTO no Makoto .
MINAMOTO no Makoto was set free , and the soldiers who had besieged his house were withdrawn .
The Emperor issued an Imperial edict and ordered an investigation of TOMO no Yoshio .
This incident was also painted in the National Treasure ' Ban Dainagon Ekotoba ' ( The Tale of Great Minister Ban ) .
It is also referred to as the Songo-jiken ( Songo Incident ) .
The hundred and nineteenth Emperor Kokaku , was the son of the Imperial Prince Kaninnomiya Sukehito .

They expanded their power in Kyoto over approximately 5 years .
They did so through acts such as refusing the delivery of Jishisen ( the land taxes paid by tenant farmers . )
Six years after this , the Nichiren sect became a prohibited religion in Kyoto .
In 810 , the abdicated Emperor Heizei moved to the old capital of Heijo-kyo .
Kusuko and Nakanari , who had been scheming to restore the Retired Emperor Heizei to the throne , greatly encouraged this conflict .
This provoked the Retired Emperor Heizei .
The news of the capital 's relocation greatly disturbed the public .
Emperor Saga was determined to reject the relocation of the capital .
Emperor Saga promoted SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro , who was a zogushi , to Dainagon ( chief councilor of state ) .
The law that ratified " Hanzei " is called the hanzei law .
It is said that the killing was the deed of the Kyoto Mimarwarigumi ( a group for the security of Kyoto )
A grave of the Iguchi family , the master of Omiya , is located in Konkai Komyo-ji Temple .

These were called gokei ( five sentences ) or gozai ( five punishments ) .
Among the provinces , districts , and neighborhoods , neighborhoods were composed of 50 homes .
This can be categorized as the age of court noble law .
It 's one of the battles in the Jisho Juei Rebellion .
Yoshinaka , who became increasingly isolated , attempted to make peace with the Taira family , but was rejected .
Yoshitsune 's troops entered the Uji-gawa River under a shower of arrows .

However , the bakufu system as the central government fell down because of the Coup of Meio .
According to the prevailing view , it was 1573 in which Nobunaga ODA ousted the then present shogun , Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA .
( There is a legend that the starting point of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI 's success was a " needle seller . " )
Even after the Disturbance , the power of the bakufu as the central government remained .
The shogun became an existence that stayed at with daimyo in various places .
As Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA died in 1511 , Sumimoto 's side became inferior in power .
Kataharu YANAGIMOTO conquered the area around Kyo .
In 1530 , Kataharu YAMAGIMOTO was assassinated .
In 1543 , Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA , insisting that he was the successor to Takakuni , fought with Harumoto HOSOKAWA .

By region
As the Takeda clan was ruined , Kai and Shinano were distributed to vassals of the Oda clan .
Among them , there are cases where a former vassal of the Takeda clan became a modern daimyo like the Sanada clan .
In every country , how to handle this power was a big problem .
In 1576 , the Hatakeyama clan surrendered to the Uesugi clan and was ruined .
However , it seems that they could not conduct complete control in each country .
In the early stage , there was conflict between Yoshioki OUCHI and Tsunehisa AMAKO .
He achieved going up to the capital ( Kyoto ) accompanying the shogun and was followed by many daimyo in the neighboring areas .
On the other hand , he had battles with the Ouchi clan several times , but it was not brought to an end .
As a result , the Mori clan became the hegemony of Chugoku .
The Hosokawa clan governed Awa .
In the Sengoku Period , the Shozui-jo Castle was the base for governing Awa .
When the Miyoshi clan declined however , they followed the Oda clan .
When Chosokabe invaded however , they made a strong resistance .
Ten years after the subjugation of Tosa , the whole of Shikoku was unified in 1585 .
It seems that the Awaji Province was ruled by the Hosokawa clan , which was shugo .
Later , because of the Conquest of Shikoku by Hideyoshi , the Chosokabe clan was confined to one country , Tosa .
The Sengoku Period of the Shimazu clan began with an internal conflict in the family .
This is also closely related to tactical doctrine of individual sengoku daimyo .
Since the Muromachi Period , busho who had interest in creative writing and painting appeared .
They sometimes evacuated to provinces to avoid the maelstrom of war .
On the other hand , Christianity that came from abroad started to also expand .
Before the sixth century , each gozoku ( local ruling family ) directly governed the land and the people .
The foundation lay in the system such as handen shuju sei ( a system of periodic reallocations of rice land ) , koseki ( the household registers ) and so on .
For this reason , shoki shoen declined until the tenth century .
Kokumen sho was valid only during the kokushi 's service , who approved the exemption .
The farmland on which the taxation was imposed was divided into the unit called myoden ( rice field lots in charge of a nominal holder ) .
These shoens are called the tax-exempt shoen estates .
Especially in the Kinai region , the rice-field donation to dominant temples and shrines became active .
These tatos are included in kaihatsu-ryoshu ( local notables who actually developed the land ) .
This became the landmark which led to the start of cloister government .
These shoens are called jitoukesho ( the shoen manor under the contract with a jito that the manor 's owner entrusts him to manage the manor and pay the customs ) .
Shugos established the territorial governance of the whole of one province .
The Ming dynasty put the imperial manors which were directly managed by the imperial court in different parts of the country .
The lords of shoens also held trials based on common law or regional customs .
Prior to the appearance of shoens , two land systems existed .
This is regarded as the first emergence of aprisio .
The lands which made up the shoens were divided into the following three strata .
These land ownerships by serfs is called villain tenure .
See the details in the section on the serf system .
The son was supposed to succeed to the profession of his father .

Among these peer groups , the Mononobe and the Otomo clans were uji in charge of military affairs .
The cohort system was gradually abolished from the end of the 8th century through the 9th century .
This was the beginning of the military aristocracy .
Needless to say , military aristocrats were required to contribute to the Imperial Court in military affairs .
He was at that point far beyond what military aristocrats could normally achieve .
The Kiyomori family gained further power and finally established the Taira clan administration .
Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI began the land survey in 1582 .
In accordance with Taiko-kenchi , Kokudaka ( crop yield ) for each province was defined .
In the Edo period , land surveys were also conducted following the example of the Taiko-kenchi .
The Sashidashi-kenchi ( or the Shincho-kenchi ) is said to be the model for the Taiko-kenchi .

Or the sand itself that causes this phenomenon .
However , westerlies have little affect on the atmosphere near to the ground .
Through these processes , larger-grain sand in the dust falls first .
On the other hand , when little rain falls in a place where kosa is supposed to occur , the occurrence frequency of kosa there tends to increase thereafter .
This is called ' background kosa . '
It has become known that this type of kosa originates in the summer and autumn when almost no kosa is observed ordinarily on the ground level .
The dust density has become increased in the last one hour = >
Accompanied by a sandstorm = >
Therefore , now , the accuracy of kosa forecast has increased .
This instrument can be used for measuring chemical characteristics of kosa and others .
Use of this instrument allows visibility levels to be measured more precisely than visually .
It is also conducted to gather sample kosa grains and to analyze them .
It is frequently reported that the occurrence of kosa has been increasing recently .
However , the frequency in each area was considerably different in around 1970s .
The colors of kosa are near to ocher , yellowish brown , or reddish brown .
Therefore , it is considered that most of the aerosol comes from kosa .
The damaged areas confirmed cover a wide area in eastern Asia .
Some call it " Yellow dust terrorism . "
Quite minute particles are included in kosa .
However , even in the same pollution level , the states of diseases depend on the individual .
Calcium carbonate included in kosa is provided with a neutralization ability .
Consequently , kosa also contributes to a reduction in the damage due to acid rain .
Measures against damage due to kosa are taken in various areas .
Therefore , it is considered that dry land has expanded in these areas as well .
For example , the one-child policy of China has played a significant role for controlling the population .
Kosa has been observed in various areas as part of weather observations .
Therefore , it is necessary to conduct more precise and more systematic measurement .
The following information is provided for the general public now :
Provided by the China Meteorological Administration .
The forecasts were only for a short-time period , or today and the next day .
ADB / GEF projects of countermeasures against kosa
This project has achieved some results , for example , the compilation of a plan to combat kosa ( refer to the web site concerned ) .
Projects by Ministry of the Environment ( refer to the web site concerned ) .
Meetings by the ministers of the environments of Japan , China and South Korea
International meetings concerning kosa research .
The following terms are used for indicating kosa in various languages :
Many of the dead were children returning from schools .
The sky looks dirty and yellow dust accumulates on the surface of materials slightly .
Issued when the density is 300 µg per cubic meter or more and it is necessary to provide the information .

And they were treated unkindly in Haihan-chiken ( abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures ) .
The Owari Domain had no power to go over it .
This domestic governing institution was called " In no cho . "
The first appearance of the term " In no cho " dates back to the reign of Emperor Uda .
The salaries of the councilors were determined by Diet Law .
The peerage councilors were selected from their peerage .

They could not , however , touch the fundamental authority of Kizokuin .
After the War , Kizokuin paticipated in deliberations on the Constitution of Japan .
This was a group of princes and marquis councilors .
It became practically a supporting group of Seiyukai .
Atsumaro KONOE , the president of Kizokuin was a member of this group .
The main members were Chokusen councilors including Koki HIROTA and Fumio GOTO .
This was called Kakusei undo ( a clean-up campaign ) .
Below is the explanation about the Kani official rank system of Japan .
See below .
Background and progress of Kaiho Rei
And Kaiho Rei was proclaimed on August 28 , 1871 .

It was opened on March 7 , 1869 .
The chairman was Tanetatsu AKIZUKI who came from Takanabe Domain .
The acting chairman was Arinori MORI who came from Satsuma Domain .
The tenure was set down 4 years and half of the members were to run in an election on the expiration of their tenure every two years .

After Shigenobu 's death , the Matsukura clan was inherited by his son Shigemasa MATSUKURA .

The passage above is said to be how Ieyasu described his youth .
In 1547 , ODAI no kata ( known as Dentsuin at that time ) was remarried to Toshikatsu HISAMATSU .
Kazumasa and Nobuyasu were familiar with each other . '
So Kazumasa fled to Hideyoshi to seek a new master . '
After Ieyasu moved to Kanto region , Kazumasa became the lord of a fief yielding 100,000 koku of rice in Shinano Province .
However , in 1613 , both lords were deprived of their domains .
There is a memorial tower for Nobuyasu in Sainen-ji Temple .
It is commonly believed that the punishment of the ISHIKAWA clan was due to the their involvement in the Nagayo OKUBO incident .
At that time , Masakazu allocated about 2,000 koku to his younger brother Masayuki KOBORI .
The second lord of the domain , Masayuki KOBORI , allocated 1,000 koku to his younger brother .
Here is the abolition of the Omi Komuro Domain .
After the establishment of the Meiji Government , the term " Rebel army " indicated antigovernment forces .
That was because Emperor Komei supported the policy of the Edo bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) .
It was an extension of this to display living residents of their colony .
This triggered the incident .
Some fierce protests came from Qing in the same manner .
SAIONJI , however , refused to agree to this on the grounds that the nation was in serious financial straits because of the Japanese-Russo War that just ended .
The Diet was supposed to reconvene on the day .
Thereby the Seiyukai Party lost its leadership in the campaign to oust the KIYOURA cabinet .
Also , the war was a remote cause of the Hongan-ji Temple power split in the Edo period .
In September of this year , Nobunaga carried out a punitive expedition to the Miyoshi clan .
Refer to ' Battle of Noda-jo Castle and Fukushima-jo Castle ' for the details of this war .
In the economic blockade , Hongan-ji Temple asked Terumoto MORI for aid .
Helplessly , Nobunaga made the soldiers withdraw while strengthening the three-side surveillance .
Now Hongan-ji Temple was isolated under complete siege .
So , Nobunaga tried to move the Imperial Court to mediate a peace agreement between the two parties .

It was FUJIWARA no Yorimichi , chief adviser to the Emperor , who appointed Naokata as tsuitoshi .
In August , the roto ( retainer ) of Tadatsune who infiltrated Kyoto was captured .
Tadatsune holed up in a military fortress in Ishimi , Isumi County , Kazusa Province and continued resistance .
The reason for this can be found in the confusion over administration of religions .
Article 1 . Organizational election of municipal public servants
Chapter 4 . Administration of properties of towns and villages
It was promulgated on May , 1890 .
In each Gun , Gunkai ( a district association ) and Gunsanjikai ( a district council ) were set up as decision-making bodies .
Two-thirds of the Gunkai members were chosen by an internal vote of town and village assemblies .
Gun did not have the right to levy taxes .
In addition , it was under the control of Minister of Home Affairs and prefectural governors .
Around the time after Russo-Japanese War , controversy erupted over abolition of Gunsei .
In 1921 , the cabinet of Prime Minister Takashi HARA abolished Gunsei .
Ever since then , however , Gun has remained merely as geographical term .
Japan also introduced Shitokan-sei when it established the Ritsuryo system .
According to the Ryo of Tang , responsibilities of each Shitokan were determined as follows .

His dead body is buried in Hannya-no , Nara .
Prince Shigehito , who has learned of the loss of his father , goes to Ninna-ji Temple and becomes a priest .
Around this time , Yorinaga 's death is reported to the Emperor 's side .
Yorinaga 's dead body is not reburied but is left deserted on the street .
The suspicions then turn toward the Emperor , who has issued the death sentence .
Sutoku spends his days lamenting his misfortune at Sanuki .
Thus the prediction of Otowaka , who was killed by Yoshitomo , has come to pass .
This is why " Hogen Monogatari " is said to have a sympathetic viewpoint toward the father and the son .
The following is a representative text of each line :
Also , a modern translation has been released by Bensei Publishing .

This text can be read on the Kyoto University Library website .
It is represented by the Kotohirabon owned by Konpira-gu Shrine .

Diaries and written records of the government officials as primary historical materials .
He also claimed that it was more reliable , compared with the record of the shogun Genji .
There is a possibility that even they didn 't know the name of Yoshinaka KISO .

The Jowa Incident is also described in this book .
( The latter is thought to have less pages chronologically out of order due to binding errors than the former . )
This code and the Goseibai-shikimoku ( code of conduct for samurai ) together are called the Joken Codes .
Along with the Goseibai-shikimoku of the Kamakura bakufu , it also had influence on the provincial codes established by daimyo ( Japanese territorial lord ) in the Sengoku Period .
They are also called Suminokura-bon or Koetsu-bon ( Koetsu Books ) .

Later , he relied on the Amago clan of Izumo .
He became a prominent leader in Aki Province .
Nobuzane fled to Izumo .
Motonari organized the Kawachi Keigoshu ( a pirate organization ) owned by the Aki-Takeda clan .
Yet , he was betrayed by Okitsune KIKKAWA .
When the Ouchi force advanced too far into the territory of the Amago clan , their lines of supply and defence were cut off .
In May , Motonari assailed the Shionoya gate of the castle but was utterly defeated .
During the rout , Motonari faced the crisis , prepared to die .
He forced Okitsune KIKKAWA , lord of the Kikkawa family , to retire .
He plotted to kill Zenkei TASAKA , Shigehira 's vassal and overseer .
He then forced Shigehira to enter into the priesthood .
He also established ' the Mori-Ryosen system . '
This would help his clan to expand its power .
He acquired dominion over most of Aki Province .
This strengthened his leadership among the cohort of pirates .
He gained dominion over the region .
Takafusa found it impossible to control the Ouchi territory without Motonari 's support .

Masayori YOSHIMI of Iwami Province then rebelled against Takafusa .
However , he was opposed by some retainers of the family who put no trust in Takafusa .
He was not able to lead his troops .
Motonari then resolved to confront Takafusa .
They would have had no chance of defeating the enemy had they squarely confronted them .
Counterfeiting Era 's handwriting , he even forged a letter in which Era promised to secretly work for him .
He made Harutaka personally assassinate Fusahide ERA .
Motonari took the initiative , raiding the Miyagawa force .
That caused the Ouchi clan 's power to diminish greatly .
He , however , continued to maintain control .
The battle stalled with both armies glaring at each other across Gono-gawa River .
A year later , in 1559 , Motonari conquered Nukuyu Castle .
Upon withdrawing his troops , he met with a surprise attack by Tsunemitsu HONJO , the lord of the castle .
Struck by Haruhisa 's main force that had converged with the castle 's troops , he suffered a crushing defeat .
( The Battle of Gorozaka ) .
Haruhisa AMAGO died in 1560 .
He repulsed the Mori force with his defense network known as " Amago jikki " ( ten branch castles of the Amago clan ) .

Motonari had been often sick since the early 1560s .

His government was not just about organizational or structural reform .
He then established a collective leadership system utilizing bugyo ( magistrates ) led by the Mori-Ryosen system .
The Mori government maintained without collapse .
He displayed the tactic of waiting to respond until the conditions were more favorable .
He thereby made sure that his enemies were properly disabled or eliminated .
We of the Mori clan should wish for the preservation of our territory only , and never wish for the world .
It has not been ascertained whether or not this was really Motonari 's will .
This is what seems to have made him leave such a will .
Such is the famous tale of ' The Three Arrows . '
He asked his retainer , ' What did you pray for ? '
Motonari answered as follows :
Motonari famously insisted on the solidarity of his family and people .
He fathered a son at the late age of 71 .
His children were to become the pillars of support to his clan following his death .

History of transportation
Up to the Sengoku period ( period of warring states )
Development of post-station towns
To promote traffic network , the construction of railways was given priority over that of roads .
After this , railway construction was promoted by both the private and public sectors .
This is the Watkins Report issued in 1956 .
The emergence of motorcycle gangs also became a social issue .
At the same time , the improvement of airports was promoted as well , and thus the size of air transportation gradually increased .
Current transportation in Japan
Therefore , there are some railways which have discontinued , especially in rural areas .
This section describes , in the broad-sense , railways in Japan .
There are some other types of railways controlled by regulations other than the Railway Business Act and the Act on Rail Tracks .
Suspended monorail / Skyrail ( Skyrail Service Hiroshima Tankyori Kotsu Seno Line )
Subways are also a common means of transportation in large cities in Japan .
In 1987 , Japan National Railways ( JNR ) was privatized and split up into JR companies .
Railways in Japan could never have maintained punctuality without their ingenious attempts and efforts .
Incidentally , the share of freight transportation has been remaining low level under 5 % .
Passengers tell the driver their destination after getting into the taxi .
The fare of general taxis consists of the following items .
The fare is flat until the taxi runs for a certain distance .
A certain amount is charged every time the taxi runs for a certain distance .
This system is often used for visiting tourist spots by a taxi .
This system can be sometimes seen in private companies that have regular patrons .
Note that this classification differs from that of the Road Traffic Act .
A charge required when customers call for a taxi
There is no such thing as a taxi that does not accept cash .
In a part of Kansai area , PiTaPa Cards are available .
These services are cheaper than taking a taxi to the airport individually .
Most of these services have a flat-rate fare no matter where a passenger boards the taxi .
These types of drivers are mainly older persons or persons with dual employment .
In case that the driver is asked to bear a special burden regarding the transportation by the passenger .
In case that the passenger is dressed filthily so that he / she might contaminate the car interior
In the event that the passenger is a critically ill person without any escort .
( 2 ) In case that the taxi has no equipment required for transportation
( 6 ) In case that the driver has a fair reason defined by the Ordinances of the Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism
( 1 ) A passenger who has explosives or other dangerous objects
Objects that cannot be carried in a taxi
Matches which weigh more than 500 grams
Issue of ' rejection of boarding ' of taxis
Keicars ( light motor vehicles ) are rarely used for other than nursing purposes .
Because there aren 't very many 24 hr LPG stations , LPG stations become crowded shortly before closing business for the day .
A meter that shows the fare
It indicates the state of the taxi .
A machine used for payment by credit card
However , there are still quite a few problems in using a debit card ; for example , the driver may have to pay a commission to some card companies .
It is used for the staff in the dispatch control center to send a taxi driver to a customer .
Taxis usually use the frequency band of 400MHz .
Advertisings on vehicles
Problems of taxis in Japan
The number of traffic accidents involving taxis is much more than that of general automobiles .
Series 300 Shinkansen train-cars and 0 series Shinkansen train-cars
For the rails , long rails are used for reducing the number of connection points .
60 Hz is used throughout the Tokaido Shinkansen line .
In this case , a dead section is used for connecting different voltage sections .
Therefore , use of the distributed traction system is more advantageous in laying and maintaining rails than that of the concentrated traction system .
Therefore , new railways for Shinkansen will be laid for this section .
The Higashi ( east ) Kyushu Shinkansen line : between Fukuoka City and Kagoshima City ( via Oita City and Miyazaki City ) , approx . 390 km
The work to construct this line started in 1974 .
After this , the basic plan became ineffective corresponding to the privatization of JNR in 1987 .
In the past , the nickname of " West Hikari " and that of " Grand-Hikari " also existed .
When this Shinkansen line started its operation , this name was used for the trains that stopped at the every station on the line .
The train-cars of the same types as those for Toki are used .
Asama ' : the trains connecting Tokyo Station to Nagano Station .
However , the railways in Europe and the United States at that time advanced further .
The technologies developed in Mantetsu were never used effectively for the railways in main land of Japan .
It is said that the term of ' Shinkansen ' originated here .
However , a considerable portion of the route was used effectively for constructing the Tokaido Shinkansen line later .
In 1951 , Shima left JNR due to some reasons .
However , use of AC power came to be applied to the electric system of Shinkansen later .
It was due to the following reasons that this area was selected for the test track section :
The catch copy was ' Hikari is going to the west . '
Furthermore , an extension of the Shinkansen to the Tohoku region was planned .
After this , the railway share of the traffic in the Tohoku and Joetsu regions increased considerably .
This fact is sometimes called the safety myth of the Shinkansen .
In particular , many falling concrete accidents inside tunnels occurred starting towards the end of the 1990s .
Therefore , each JR company was requested to take thorough measures for maintaining the facilities .
Based on this experience , earthquake-resistant measures , such as reinforcement of elevated bridges , have been taken .
In the case of the Toki 325 train , it was lucky that no train was running on the track on the other side .
It planned to increase the speed of TGV to 360 km / h .
To stabilize the railways , the trains were operated at 180 km / h in some sections .
In the United States , there is a plan to construct a high-speed railway line between Los Angeles and San Francisco of California .
JR Tokai has promoted selling the Shinkansen system for the route actively .
India has started efforts to introduce high-speed railway lines in earnest .
For more information , refer to the Kyushu Shinkansen line in the connected ride fee system .
In long-distance transportation services , competition with airline companies continued .
In addition , the existence of the frequent flier program ( so-called mileage services in Japan ) by airline companies has affected the competition significantly .
Competition with limited expresses of private railway companies
Competition with limited expresses of Kintetsu Railway
A direct competition is found between Nagoya and Osaka .
The competition started when the Tokaido Shinkansen line started operation in 1964 .
It is said that one train-car operations were considered at some point as well .
Details of the historical aspect described above are described in the history of Kintetsu limited expresses .
Competition with higher category trains of Tobu Railway Co . , Ltd .
Competition with Odakyu Romance Car trains
It might be said that harmonious operations are achieved there .
Therefore , Shinkansen is sometimes differentiated from other high-speed railway systems .
A place named ' Shinkansen ' exists in Kannami Town , Takada-gun , Shizuoka Prefecture .
All lines are under direct jurisdiction of the Osaka Branch of the West Japan Railway Company .
The Yamatoji Line is one railway line that connects Nara and Osaka .
