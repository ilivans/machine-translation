it was created in the edo period .
it is often seen in minyo ( folk songs ) of all areas in japan .
it is also said that the name of dodoitsu appeared after the last days of the tokugawa government .
hiko is to recite waka to a tune , and there are some schools of reciting such as the ayanokoji school and the reizei school .
today it is seen at the new year imperial poetry reading party , certain events in shrines , etc .
before the fixed form of waka was established , it had been called jodai kayo .
it is also said that the screams and cheers let out with excitement increasingly grew to be songs sung in groups at festivals and during laborious work .
most of them are considered to have been lost without being written down , but about 300 poems have survived in the books of " kojiki ( records of ancient matters ) , " " nihon shoki ( chronicles of japan ) , " " fudoki ( notes on local legends and geography ) , " " manyoshu , " " kogoshui ( commentaries on ancient words and practices ) , " " kinkafu ( poetry collection ) " and " bussokusekika hi ( stele ) . "
there was a group event called utagaki ( dancing and singing feast of young men and women ) as one of the customs in those days .
jodai kayo came to be an origin of ceremonial songs such as kagurauta ( songs ) and saibara ( folk songs ) , which were accompanied with instruments , and its form and poetic devices became progenitors of the later waka .
jodai kayo in " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " were especially called kiki kayo .
poetic devices such as tsuiku , kurikaeshi ( repetition ) , makura kotoba , jo kotoba , etc . , were used for a verse form of basic lines of five and seven syllables , like katauta , sedoka , tanka and choka .
it is said that manyoshu was compiled by many people over a long period of time , but it was otomo no yakamochi who in the end edited and made a 20-volume anthology as it is .
during the early heian period , chinese poetry overwhelmed waka as a public literature .
however , in the middle of the heian period the decline of tang and abolishment of kentoshi ( the embassy to the tang dynasty ) lessened the influence of chinese culture , and kokufu bunka was developed .
in its process , waka gradually regained its position as an official culture along with the development of kana characters ( the japanese syllabaries ) , and uta awase ( poetry match ) came to be held .
subsequently , waka became a synonym for tanka .
" kokin wakashu " was compiled by imperial command of emperor daigo in 905 ; the compilers were ki no tsurayuki , ki no tomonori , oshikochi no mitsune and mibu no tadamine .
it contains about 1000 poems in 20 volumes , which were composed after " manyoshu . "
it followed a tradition of " kokin wakashu , " which had elegant , refined styles .
during the late heian period , the sekkan ( regent and chief councilor ) government began to decline , and a change occurred in the aristocratic culture .
compared with the conservative " go shui wakashu , " the following " kinyo wakashu ( a collection of golden leaves ) " was innovative and focused on fresh descriptive poems ; however , the subsequent " shika wakashu ( a collection of verbal flowers of japanese poetry ) " marked a return to the conservative style .
it shows a tendency toward the principle of art for art 's sake in the destruction of the aristocracy and the rise of samurai warriors , elevating the status of waka in the late heian period .
the following " shin kokin wakashu ( new collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry ) " was compiled and dedicated to the emperor by toshinari 's disciple .
in the kamakura period , court nobles who had been deprived of their power came to depend on the traditional culture , so they composed waka energetically .
bearing feelings of rivalry toward kamakura , the retired emperor go-tobain who showed much enthusiasm for waka ordered the compilation of " shin kokin wakashu . "
the principle of art for art 's sake , as seen in senzai wakashu , was further refined , and poetic devices reached their culmination .
on the other hand , the following two people were respected : saigyo , who made poems on love toward nature and his view of life , and minamoto no sanetomo , who composed poems in the manyo style .
after the death of fujiwara no sadaie , who had been a central figure in the compilation of " shin kokin wakashu , " his son tameie became a mentor of the tanka composers ' society , but after tameie passed away , both the fujiwara family and the tanka composers ' society were divided into three schools : the nijo , kyogoku and reizei .
compared with haikai , which had been just generated , waka was traditional japanese culture that had continued since jodai ( ancient times ) ; therefore , its degree of innovation was suppressed .
the keien school had been a leading school in the tanka composers ' society until the early meiji period .
however , in order to discern the new waka from the traditional one , these new poems came to be commonly called ' tanka ' ( see also tanka ) .
people who compose waka are called kajin poets .
see also the list of kajin poets .
kasei ( great poet ) is an honorific title given to a master of waka .
kashu is a book in which waka are collected .
the collection was compiled by imperial order .
a collection of poems compiled by individuals or nongovernmental circles
above all , ogura hyakunin isshu ( one hundred poems by one hundred poets ) , compiled by fujiwara no sadaie , is familiar to everyone , and it has had great influence on the japanese people 's appreciation of waka .
a collection of poems written by a single author .
because waka began as accompaniment to a tune , the number of letters ( the number of syllables , or mora ) is not strictly confined if it is read in a singsong manner .
the idea of ' extra or insufficient syllables ' arose from a sense of beauty for a fixed form of verse to write down instead of reciting it .
in the context of western music , waka has a slow quadruple time that establishes its rhythm in sets of two bars .
a verse form depends on the combination and number of the rhythm .
for example , a tanka is made up of five sets of two bars , giving a total number of ten bars .
an example of applying western-style harmony to tanka and deserting the manner of reciting waka ( rhythm ) is ' kimigayo ( the japanese national anthem ) , ' and in this case the rhythm of tanka , as stated above , was abandoned in the adjustment to the western system of harmony .
yoshimitsu ashikaga was the 3rd seii taishogun of the muromachi shogunate and reigned from 1368 to1394 .
title of nobility : monarch of japan
his wife was nariko hino , a daughter of the dainagon ( great councilor ) tokimitsu hino , and she became his wife thanks to the arrangement and support of a beloved princess of the emperor go-kogon , senshi hino .
after that , yasuko hino ( later kitayamain ) , her niece , became his wife after the death of nariko .
yoshimitsu was also called " muromachi-dono " ( lord muromachi ) , because he moved the imperial palace to kitakoji muromachi .
he was born in 1358 .
it fell precisely on the 100th day after the death of takauji ashikaga .
when yoshimitsu was young , there were constant struggles between the muromachi shogunate and the yoshino imperial court , and moreover , since the kanno disturbance , an internal conflict of the ashikaga family , had occurred , the strife between the shogunate and the court intensified .
after his farther yoshiakira died from an illness in 1367 , yoshimitsu became the 3rd shogun at the age of 11 .
while the administration of the shogunate was led by shugo daimyos of the ashikaga clan , including yoriyuki hosokawa , who were in charge of kanrei , he studied imperial governance .
in 1374 , he welcomed yoriko hino as his wife .
in 1370 , in order to strengthen control over kyoto , the court gave him authority to control the sanmon kunin ( a clique of influential people of enryaku-ji temple and its affiliates , as well as member of the temple )
in 1378 , the shogunate was moved from sanjo bomon to kitanokoji muromachi .
the shogunate , after the move , was nicknamed " hana no gosho " ( flower palace ) , and also called the muromachi bakufu ( shogunate ) after its new location .
the administration and taxation authorities , which had been divided between the court and the shogunate , were integrated and a unit called hokoshu or bugyoshu was organized to handle practical matters , and was a standing army comparable to the shugo daimyo 's army in military strength .
he also undertook the following actions to demonstrate his power : visit to todai-ji temple and kofuku-ji temple in 1385 , sight-seeing trip to mt . fuji in suruga province in 1388 , visit to itsukushima shrine in aki province in 1389 .
after the death of yoriyasu , he subdued the toki clan , taking advantage of the internal conflict while the toki were fighting on two sides .
the same year , he finally rose to the post of juichii daijodaijin ( chancellor of the realm ) .
it is thought that he became a priest in order to gain the ability to control temples and shrines , the remaining sphere he wanted to conquer after reaching the peak of the aristocratic spheres as seii taishogun , taisei daijin and junsangu .
in 1395 , sadayo imagawa , who held independent authority as kyushu tandai , was dismissed .
after the integration of the northern and southern courts , he again intended to negotiate with ming , under the nominal title of " seii shogun of japan , yoshimitsu minamoto , " but the government of ming would not accept an envoy dispatched by someone who presented himself as a vassal of the emperor , because ming traditionally did not trade with any retainer of a vassal .
in 1404 , he started japan-ming trade that took the form of tribute to the ming emperor . he also was able to suppress japanese pirates ( however , before the ming 's government could dispatch an envoy to convey the emperor 's gratitude to the japanese government , the seinan war broke out in ming , emperor jianwen abdicated , and emperor yongle took the throne ) .
yoshimitsu , who adored ming culture , pressed the imperial court to use the chinese character 洪 in the name of japanese eras after the taizu of ming , emperor hongwu ( 洪武帝 ) , but this was rejected by for various reasons , including the facts mentioned above .
yoshimitsu felt offended , and after that , he was never allowed to change the name of the era during his reign , and that is why the oei was the longest era before meiji .
in 1397 , he received hokusantei in kitayama , kyoto , from kintsune saionji , and constructed a mountain villa called kitayamatei or kitayamadono ( later rokuon-ji temple ) , placing a reliquary in the center .
the culture of this period is called the kitayama culture , where the samurai style , aristocratic style and the tang style ( zen buddhism style ) were merged .
it is said that during his life yoshimitsu did not get along well with his son yoshimochi , and the policies that yoshimitsu introduced , such as the imperial court policy , control of the aristocracy and shugo daimyo , and foreign policy including trade with ming , were denounced by yshimochi .
the hokusantei , a heritage left by yoshimitsu , was also destroyed by yoshimochi , except for the kinkaku .
afterwards , the descendants of yoshitsugu fled to echizen , and they were called " kuradanigosho . "
yoshimitsu 's son , yoshinori ashikaga , intended to continue yoshimitsu 's policies when he became the 6th shogun , but he was assassinated by mitsusuke akamatsu during the kakitsu war .
yoshimitsu 's grandson , yoshimasa ashikaga who became the 8th shogun , also tried to follow his grandfather and father 's policies , but as he became disgusted with the onin war and the puppet administration controlled by his vassals , he lost enthusiasm for political management .
the shugo daimyos , who had served submissively during yoshimitsu 's reign , began to take a defiant attitude toward the government again .
yoshinari tanaka , akira imatani , and others propose a theory that yoshimitsu had an intention to usurp the imperial throne ; and based on this theory , some novelists including chogoro kaionji and motohiko izawa present their opinion that yoshimitsu 's sudden death might confirm that he was assassinated to interrupt his plot .
he also usurped various authorities , such as those for rituals and for personnel affairs , from the imperial family . in april 1408 , one month before his death , he carried out the ceremony of genpuku ( coming-of-age ceremony for boys ) for his second son , yoshitsugu , on a scale comparable to ceremonies for an imperial prince .
there is another theory in which yoshimochi 's side was worried about the future succession due to yoshimitsu 's excessive partiality to yoshitsugu .
imatani supposes that yoshimitsu was strongly influenced by china ( ming ) , but he did not subscribe to idea that incumbent emperors could be overthrown by decree of heaven , instead making use of " yamataishi , " a popular prophecy of the time .
but , if the temporary unification of emperor go-murakami in the shohei unification during the civil war of kanno is counted , then emperor go-komatsu is the 100th emperor .
thus , it could be interpreted to mean that japan would be ruined after a monkey or dog had been called a hero .
the idea that the imperial reign terminates with the 100th emperor is documented in gukansho by jien and other writings , and is supposed to have been widely accepted .
on the other hand , izawa supposes that the author might have gotten the hint from the tale of genji .

located in the higashiyama ward of kyoto city , sanjyo-keihan station is a stop on the tozai line , a kyoto municipal subway line .
each station on the tozai line has its own color , and the color used at sanjyo-keihan station is scarlet tinged with purple .
refer to sanjyo-keihan for details on the station 's surroundings , including the location of the bus station .
kyoto city bus and other public transport firms have been calling this spot " sanjyo-keihan " since before the subway line was opened .
the municipal subway chose to use the name sanjyo-keihan because keihan was the name of another railway company and there was already a station named sanjyo in kyoto prefecture .
the station facilities were built by historical corporation of tozai line of kyoto municipal subway lines , a third sector company .
the keihan keishin line uses the same tracks as the tozai line . they originally planned to share the tracks to this station because the keihan keishin line ran between misasagi station and this station , which was above ground at the time . however , as they were unable to secure enough space around this area for a turnaround , the keihan keishin line decided to extend the shared section to the next station , kyoto shiyakusyo-mae , when sanjyo-keihan station was opened . ( they later extended the shared section even further to uzumasa tenjingawa station when the tozai line was extended to that station in 2008 . )
a region of honshu along the seto inland sea that was one of the goki-shichido ( literally , " five provinces and seven circuits " ) administrative divisions .
a highway that traversed sanyodo , which was one of the goki-shichido .
a route built during the ritsuryo period .

one of the goki-shichido , referring to a region of honshu along the seto inland sea
mimasaka-no-kuni - separated from bizen-no-kuni in 713 .
the sanyodo was only the first graded highway among the shichido , and as such it was regarded as the most important because of the expected passage and stays of foreign missions .
the eastern end of the road varied in response to the transfer of capitals such as heijo-kyo and heian-kyo .
the sanyodo stretched northwest from harima-no-kuni to mimasaka-no-kuni , which was away from the main route .
the edo shogunate improved the sanyodo as part of its road maintenance policy , which focused on five major highways .
during the edo period , the sanyodo ( otherwise known as saigoku-kaido ) connected kyoto to shimonoseki city and further extended to kokura city by crossing the kammon-kaikyo strait from shimonoseki .
this route was part of the truck line linking edo and nagasaki city .
the meiji government started its road management system by assigning numbers to national highways .
during the meiji period , the sanyodo of the edo period and earlier became a section of national highway 3 connecting tokyo city and kobe city ( separating from national highway 2 in kyoto city ) ; and of national highway 4 connecting tokyo and nagasaki city ; during the taisho period it was integrated into national highway 2 connecting tokyo and kagoshima city ( separating from national highway 1 in mie prefecture ) .
the sanyodo has been passed down to national highway 2 today , which connects osaka city and kita kyushu city .
its route , however , differs from that of the ritsuryo and edo periods in many places .
national highway 2 from okayama city ( okayama prefecture ) to fukuyama city ( hiroshima prefecture ) takes a very different route ( kamogata-orai route ) .
the sanyo jidoshado expressway and the railway lines of the sanyo main line and the sanyo shinkansen line roughly follow the historical sanyodo .
the sanyodo has served its function of connecting the kinki region and kyushu since the ritsuryo period , and it continues in that manner today .
when people say " sanyodo " today , they are generally referring to the sanyo jidoshado highway .
the historical sanyodo and the roads running in parallel with it are collectively called " old sanyodo " in okayama prefecture and east hiroshima prefecture , because national highway 2 does not follow it between okayama city ( okayama prefecture ) and fukuyama city ( hiroshima prefecture ) .
kurama-dera temple is a buddhist temple located in kurama honmachi , sakyo ward , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
it is said to have been established by gantei , a leading disciple of ganjin .
in this temple , the honzon ( main image of worship ) is referred to as " sonten . "
" sonten " is said to be the honzon that is a trinity of vaisravana , saharabhuja and goho maoson .
is located at the north of kyoto basin , on the sourthern slope of mount kurama , where rich natural environment remains .
kurama is also famous as the place where ushiwakamaru ( minamoto no yoshitsune ) trained himself , and it is also known as the setting for jiro osaragi 's book , " kurama tengu . "
it is the no. 19 new saigoku kannon pilgrimage site .
gantei was the youngest among the eight high disciples who ganjin brought back with him from tang ( present day china ) .
one night , in the third year of hoki , gantei saw a spiritual dream , which told him that there is a spiritual mountain in the north of yamashiro province .
gantei , who set off to visit the spiritual mountain , saw a white horse with a saddle made by treasures on top of a mountain .
that was mount kurama .
gantei , on entering the mountain , was attacked and nearly killed by an ogre who took the form of a woman , but when he was in extreme danger , a dead tree fell down and crushed the ogre .
the next morning , a statue of vaisravana was there , and it is said that gantei built a temple to worship this statue .
this story about gantei is only seen in " anbagaiji engi " , and it is not clear how far it tells an actual historical event .
nevertheless , it is notable that a priest of south capital ( nara ) took part in establishing the temple , as in the case of the establishment of kiyomizutemple .
later , in 796 , fujiwara no isendo , who was in charge of building an official temple , to-ji temple , wished to build a temple to place a kannon that he personally worshiped .
isendo became suspicious saying , " i worship kannon , but it is vaisravana that is worshipped here . "
thus it is said that isendo made a statue of sahasrabhuja and enshrined it together with vaisravana .
kurama-dera temple became a temple of shingon sect from around the time when priest buen of to-ji temple entered kurama temple during kanpyo era ( from 889 to 897 ) at the end of the 9th century , but it changed to tendai sect in the 12th century ; since then it has been under the control of shoren-in for a long time .
it appears to have attracted worshippers widely during the latter half of heian period , as can seen by the fact that emperor shirakawa came to worship in 1091 and moromichi fujiwara , the kanpaku , in 1099 .
" the pillow book " names the front approach of ninety-nine prayers of kurama temple as an example of " something which is near but also far " .
kurama temple has been burned down many times , including by the fire of year 1126 .
in 1812 ( ninth year of bunka of edo period ) , there was a great fire that engulfed the whole mountain in flames , and more recently , the main shrine was burned down by a fire in year 1945 .
koun shigaraki , a chief priest in the showa era , started kurama-kokyo sect in 1947 .
in 1949 the temple became independent from tendai sect and is now the head temple of kurama-kokyo sect .
in mount kurama , located in the mountains of kyoto , mountain ascetic hermits actively practiced vajrayana buddhism .
therefore , it is said that tengus , who are spirits of the mountains , live in kurama .
the highest-ranking tengu that lives in kurama is called sojobo , and mount kurama is said to be one of the most supreme mountains for tengu .
however , form of worship at the current kurama temple after the establishment of kurama-kokyo is unique , and some explanation is necessary regarding its honzon .
according to the explanation by the temple after the establishment of kurama-kokyo , the honzon of kurama temple main shrine golden hall ( the main shrine ) is said to be " sonten . "
within the shrine , vaisravana is enshrined in the center , saharabhuja is on the right side facing it , and goho maoson on the left side , and the three are collectively referred to as " sonten . "
" sonten " is said to be " the cosmic energy that gives lfe and existence . "
vaisravana , saharabhuja and goho maoson that are enshrined in golden hall of the main shrine are all secret buddha statues [ not open for public viewing ] ; in their stead statues referred to as " omae-dachi " are enshrined in front of these secret buddha statues .
omae-dachi maoson statue looks like an unworldly person , with wings on its back , and a long beard , and has a high nose .
the aureola is made from tree leaves .
goho maoson enshrined in two-storied pagoda has a similar form .
therefore , it is believed that " kurama tengu " was initially goho maoson .
the cable car from sanmon station to tahoto station started operating in 1957 .
tahoto was rebuilt in 1959 .
great hall was rebuilt in year 1971 .
shinden was built in 1924 .
tenhorindo hall was rebuilt in 1969 .
mao-den of penetralia is a small shrine on top of a oddly-shaped rock located on a mountain road on the way from the main shrine to kibune shrine in the west .
it enshrines maoson , which is said to have arrived on earth from venus 6.5 million years ago .
the current building was rebuilt after being burnt down in 1945 .
reihoden hall is located at the back of the main shrine .
on the 3rd floor there is a sanctuary of buddhist statues , which exhibits cultural properties including three standing statues : wooden statue of bishamonten , wooden statue of kosshouten , and wooden statue of zennishi-doji .
there is a view that the honzon of kurama-dera temple were these three statues of bishamonten , and there is another view that the honzon probably looked similar to the tobatsu-bishamonten of the latter half of heian era , which is an important cultural property ; this statue is also enshrined in reihoden hall .
articles excavated from the ruin of kyozuka , which are items born from the idea of the latter day of the law during the latter half of the heian period can also be seen here .
also , akiko yosano 's library , named " tohaku-tei " , has been moved from its original location and reconstructed in front of reihoden hall .

because it is hard to visit and worship on foot for the elderly people , cable car ( mount kurama cable railway ) is operates between nio-mon and two-storied pagoda .
from the two-storied pagoda to main shrine golden hall , you need to walk about 10 minutes on a stone paved road .
if you are visiting and worshipping on foot , you need to go via yuki shrine .
access from kibune side
the numbers in brackets are altitudes measurements based on that of nio-mon ( unit : m ) .
the entrance from kibune side is called nishi-mon .
this route is said to be the route that ushiwakamaru ran , when he trained with tengu .
as you will be crossing one mountain , it will be harder than climbing from the kurama side .
it will take about 50 minutes on foot , even for a grown man .

kit , shinshu university , and tokyo university of agriculture and technology , are praised as classic 3 textile colleges .
in fiscal heisei 19 , kit ranked the first of all national colleges at the number of successful candidates who took the test of the first-class registered architect .
myo ( 妙 ) and ho ( 法 ) , known as " gozan no okuribi " , can be seen nearby from the campus .
the ultimate honchi is considered to be hossin ( the truth of the universe ) and is therefore called honchi-hossin .
as the " gon " of gongen means " provisional " or " temporary , " as shown in " gon-dainagon ( an acting chief councilor of state ) , gongen indicates a buddha that has tentatively appeared in the form of a god .
the concept of honchi originated from the inclusive nature of buddhism , which encompassed a wide range of indigenous religions as it spread throughout the region .
the thought also gave rise to a theory of esoteric buddhism ( of the later mahayana buddhism ) that kajishin like fudo myo-o ( acala ) is the embodiment of dainichi nyorai ( vairocana ) .
it was seng-zhao , of the late qin , who first brought the concept to buddhism .
in japan , as is evident in the confrontation between the mononobe clan and the soga clan during the nara era , there has been a dividing line between shinto and buddhism since it was officially introduced to japan .
they are , for example , jitsurui no kami ( jitsurui gods ) or jissha no kami ( jissha gods ) , as opposed to gonsha no kami .
to make their position clear , some buddhists codified a warning that permitted people to respect gongeshin but not jitsurui no kami .
this must have been an intentional effort to keep buddhism separate from shinto .
by the middle of the kamakura era there appeared a group of people who insisted in the shinpon butsujaku theory that buddhas were in turn the embodiment of shinto gods and that shinto gods were the masters that buddhas followed .
this theory was originated by shinto people who had complained about buddhism , which had been dominant over shinto , and wanted shinto to achieve independent status from it .
additionally , an attempt was made to theorize shinto by borrowing the doctrine of the tendai sect , which had adopted the reality-affirming hongaku philosophy , and to re-edit several kinds of theory books by falsely attributing them to kukai ; but later these works were organized by yukitada and ieyuki watarai .
the buddha , the identity of the gods , is called honchibutsu .
buddhas that are forcibly linked to shinto gods are different from religion to religion , faith to faith , temple to temple and shrine to shrine .
the following shows some of the relationships between suijakushin and honchibutsu :
seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) was one of the shogun positions in japan 's ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) .
it was abolished in the meiji restoration .
it was one of the names given to the general dispatched to the eastern part of the country from the nara period to the heian period .
although there were no posts called seiju taishogun or seiban taishogun , there were the similar posts of seiteki daishogun and seisei taishogun .
although he was formally a retainer appointed by imperial edict , he was in fact the ruler of japan who even held sway over the imperial court , and typically was treated as the king by outsiders .
the seii taishogun was a general appointed for conquering ' barbarians , ' and led an army in an advance from the pacific ocean side .
a general who led an army 's advance to the japan sea side was called seiteki daishogun , and one who led an army 's advance into kyushu was called seisei taishogun .
it is thought that this was an adaptation of the sinocentrism of ' shii ' ( four barbarians ) , ' toi , seiju , namban and hokuteki . '
on february 17 , 793 , seitoshi was changed to seiishi .
tamuramaro brought aterui , of the ezo of isawa , who had fought stubbornly until then , back to the capital , thereby conquering that land .
practically speaking , tamuramaro can be seen as the first seii taishogun .
later , on april 17 of 811 , during a battle with the ezo , funya no watamaro was appointed seii shogun , without the ' tai , ' and on december 11 of that year reported the end of the conquest of the ezo , and mononobe no taritsugu , who had been fukushogun , rose to chinju shogun ( without the ' fu ' ) , but on november 17 , 814 , became again seii shogun without the ' tai . '
in fact , below the seii taishogun were the posts of seii fukushogun , seii gungen , seii gunso , etc .
at first minamoto no yoritomo was nothing but the leader of the kanto bushidan ( kamakura-dono ) , and did not hold a position under the ritsuryo system .
that is to say that at first he was only the head of a provincial insurrection , the same as taira no masakado .
in contrast to that , yoritomo worked toward elevating the status of warriors themselves .
with respect to the imperial court , they sought a suitable position in order to establish the independent sovereignty of the warriors .
yoshinaka kiso , who advanced into the central area and kyoto , took the position called ' seii taishogun , ' which had previously existed .
furthermore , it is thought that , as a post that would conquer yoritomo of bando , ' seito taishogun , ' a post previously taken by fujiwara no tadabumi to conquer taira no masakado of bando , was better than ' seii taishogun , ' which conquered the ezo of ou .
the oshu fujiwara clan ruled the northeast region at that time , as it was an area to which the imperial court 's rule did not extend .
ryuei is another name for the shogunate .
this seems to have been the yoritomo government in microcosm .
however , the konoe daisho was required , by the nature of that position , to live in kyoto , and was not suited to moving toward independence in kanto .
it is thought that the notion of using the title of ' former udaisho ' for heads of state in the kamakura government was not unheard of .
also , compared to the oshu fujiwara clan 's chinjufu shogun , it lacked the important , active element of ' warrior 's self-rule . '
what yoritomo turned his attention to then was the office of ' seii taishogun . '
as military rule ( regional sovereignty ) , it was the same as the chinjufu shogun .
however , given that the goal of this position was to lead the bando soldiers ( in this case , warriors from eastern japan ) to victory over the ezo of ou ( in this case , the oshu fujiwara clan ) , it was traditionally a post superior to that of chinjufu shogun .
to put it another way , the seii taishogun was the one who placed a private position called kamakura-dono to rule as a leader of the warriors of eastern japan , shugo and jito throughout the country , was recognized as udaisho with the authority to exercise military police powers , had family organs of clan governance treated the same as official government offices , and bundled it all together and officially secured it .
however , there is reason to believe that the post of seii taishogun was deemed necessary especially in the oshu war to defeat the oshu fujiwara clan , and when he was in fact appointed in 1192 it had already lost its importance to yoritomo .
yoritomo was not in fact very attached to the seii taishogun post , and indicated his intent to resign 2 years later in 1194 .
also , minamoto no yoriie was his heir and right away was appointed to sakone no chujo , and then saemon no kami , and was proclaimed seii taishogun 3 years later .
then at the time of the hiki yoshikazu incident , the succession of the positions of sotsuibushi and sojito were in question , and the shogun posts were not involved .
consequently , at this stage the shogun post was not an absolute requirement for leadership of the warrior families , and may not have been seen as that important .
on the other hand , the post of shogun was proclaimed first when it came to succeeding minamoto no sanetomo .
from the kamakura period on , after minamoto no yoritomo took the position of seii taishogun and started the shogunate , the warrior families came to control japanese politics .
although it was originally a post bestowed by the imperial court , actual appointments , except for a time during the new kemmu government , were at the request of the person whose influence placed him at the pinnacle of samurai society .
formally speaking , among the nobles it was recognized that the court was the true government and the shogunate was a temporary government in the provinces .
it was customarily accepted by the warrior families that ' the families that could rise to shogun , leader of the samurai , were limited to those extending from the seiwa genji . '
however , nobunaga oda in fact received an imperial recommendation for ' appointment to seii taishogun , ' so realistically there was no basis for the idea that one could not be shogun if he was not from the minamoto clan ( it seems that the reason ieyasu claimed minamoto heritage was not only to become shogun , but that by becoming the minamoto clan chief and entering the post of shogun , he would oppose hideyoshi 's warrior kampaku system and aimed to gain authority to rule over both the warriors and the nobles ) .
furthermore , even after yoritomo , there are examples of regent shogun and imperial shogun , so it was not in fact limited to the seiwa minamoto clan .
a recently popular explanation on the subject is that , since ' seii taishogun ' was originally a post for leading soldiers of eastern japan in conquest over the ezo , the condition for assuming office was that he had to be ' someone who controls eastern japan in some form . '
there are various opinions as to whether or not nobunaga oda wanted to be seii taishogun , but it is not possible to know for sure .
in fact , there is some speculation that what became a nominal qualification for the imperial recommendation for appointment to seii taishogun was that nobunaga wiped out the takeda clan , who were eastern japan daimyo , and effectively made the hojo clan of kanto subservient .
also , there are those who say that hideyoshi toyotomi was not able to become seii taishogun because he lost to ieyasu tokugawa in the battles of komaki and nagakute .
however , hideyoshi was appointed to kampaku , a higher ranking position than seii taishogun .
for that reason , it is possible to speculate that hideyoshi was not interested in the shogun post , and wanted not a simple samurai government , but a new government that would subsumed the nobles .
on the other hand , there was previously , among the nobles , a tendency to view a person 's pedigree - whether minamoto or taira clan - as ' taira who are close to the nobles ' or ' the warrior minamoto clan who are difficult to control . '
also stemming from this came the idea that the minamoto and taira clans , or the minamoto and taira families , alternately take control of political power in japan ( gempei kotai shiso ) .
