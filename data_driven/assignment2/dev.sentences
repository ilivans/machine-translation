jodo shinshu ( shin-buddhism / true pure land sect ) is one of the sects of japanese buddhism , and a religious community that shinran , an apprentice of honen , succeeded and which developed honen 's doctrine ( jodo shu / pure land buddhism ) in the early kamakura period .
due to the historical background of the origin of the sect name , most sects belonging to this religion call themselves shinshu as a sect name .
it used to also be called ikko shu and monto shu .
through this , the doctrine of shinshu is called " shinjin shoin , shomyo ho-on " ( faith makes it happen , and praying is for gratitude ) .
the principal image ( honzon ) is only amida nyorai .
however , takada school and a part of the sect have amida nyorai , kanzeon bosatsu and seishi bosatsu as their principal images , in zenko-ji amida sanson style .
rennyo mentioned in " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " ;
" not forgetting the kindness of mida , who decided that we could go to heaven long time ago , when achieving enlightenment is what faith is about .
this is a big misconception .
even though we know the story of mida nyorai 's achieving enlightenment , it does not mean anything if we do not know the story of faith in tariki that we can go to heaven . "
he explained here that knowing how nyorai became buddha is merely knowledge , and it is important to know the origin of faith in tariki given by nyorai ( faith in truth ) .
he confirmed shinjin shoin here and defined correctly , and never mentioned " reciting nenbutsu simply takes everyone to paradise " .
in jodo shinshu , faith given by nyorai helps people .
nenbutsu is definitely recited for gratitude , not the condition of going to heaven .
shinran also mentioned " what gets you to nehan ( nirvana ) is only faith " in " kyogo shinsho " , and " regard that true faith gets you to anoku bodai ( ultimate enlightenment ) " in " songo shinzo meimon " .
what makes shinshu greatly different from other buddhist sects is that monks have no commandments and are allowed to eat meat and to get married ( nikujiki-saitai ) . ( shinshu was the only sect that allowed monks to get married until the meiji period . )
originally , shinran learned that helping those who cannot help but stray from the concept of a general monk ( who enters the priesthood and practices asceticism , renouncing the world ) and the norm of buddhists ( laity ) living in the world is hongan nenbutsu ( praying for the vows ) from his master honen , and became the first monk to openly get married and have a child .
therefore , shinshu has two lineages , which are homyaku ( master -apprentice relationship ) and kechimyaku ( blood relationship ) .
and the given name is called homyo instead of kaimyo .
with its doctrine that everyone can go to heaven ( ojo jobutsu ) only by trusting nyorai 's power ( in other words , if acquiring true faith ) , shinshu , compared to other sects , is free from many religious exercises and customs , and makes much of nenbutsu and mombo ( learning the teachings of buddha ) for ho-on shatoku ( gratitude for kindness and virtue ) .
shinshu also encouraged each household to enshrine its honzon ( myogo honzon of " namu amida butsu " , or a picture or statue of amida nyorai ) .
the " rules " on shogon ( decoration ) of the buddhist altar for enshrinement are more strict than other sects .
a honzon enshrined and decorated in the buddhist altar is called " onaibutsu " in shinshu .
shinshu doesn 't use this as a family altar or prayer altar .
the honzan of each shinshu sect basically has a goei-do hall to enshrine a portrait of shinran , the founder , as well as a main hall ( amida-do hall ) to enshrine amida nyorai , the honzon .
additionally , the architecture of shinshu temples has unique features rarely seen in other sects , such as wider gejin ( nave ) compared to naijin ( chancel ) .
each sect holds a memorial service called " ho-onko " on the anniversary of the death of the founder shinran sho 'nin .
this is the biggest event in a year .
( see the schedule of goshoki ho-onko by sect for details . )
the works of shichi koso ( seven high priests ) are also highly respected , although they are not scriptures .
" muryojukyo ubadaisha ganshoge " by tenjin was especially esteemed along with jodo sanbukyo by his master honen , who called these " sankyo ichiron " ( three sutras and one book ) .
shinran especially esteemed " bussetsu muryojukyo " and called it " daimuryojukyo " or " daikyo " .
works of shichi koso
though " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " by rennyo is respected along with the legitimate scriptures by hongan-ji school and otani school , it is not used by some sects such as takada school .
( since rennyo had kechimyaku from hongan-ji temple , the sects who value homyaku from the founder shinran do not use his work .
hongan-ji school of rennyo and takada school have a history of fight and conflict . )
the founder shinran took the lineage of tariki nenbutsu to shakamuni and shichi koso into consideration , and devoted himself to succeed " the teachings of jodo shu as the true religion " and to enhance it , through his life after he regarded honen ( the founder of jodo shu ) as his master .
different interpretations of hongan and nenbutsu by the apprentices after honen 's death made seizan and other schools of jodo shu criticize shinran .
" soshi sho 'nin ( shinran ) already established jodo shinshu - it has superior significance to jodo shu and he added the letter shin ( true ) and named it jodo shinshu . "
this shows that the view of the name of jodo shinshu , has changed with the times .
after shinran died , it was formed as an independent religion from jodo shu .
though the successors of the teachings of shinran had the feeling that their own doctrine was the true teaching for going to jodo , they named themselves just shinshu at that time because naming themselves jodo shinshu could be interpreted as denial of jodo shu .
the conflict between jodo shinshu and jodo shu over the question whether or not the shinran lineages could name themselves " jodo shinshu " was called shumei ronso , which lasted for 15 years from 1774 .
in 1872 , dajokan seiin issued an edict to each prefecture , saying " the name of ikko shu can be changed to shinshu , " and finally here in the modern ages , describing it as " ( jodo ) shinshu " was allowed .
the days of shinran
after shinran died , his great-grandson kakunyo ( 1270-1351 ) alleged the legitimacy of succession of shinran 's grave on the grounds of sandai-denji ( tradition of three generation ) and so on , and built hongan-ji temple ( also known as otani hongan-ji temple ) and called himself the third head-priest of hongan-ji temple .
against his movement , ryogen ( 1295-1336 ) , the seventh head-priest of bukko-ji temple , who succeeded the lineage of shinran 's disciples in kanto region , and other homyaku gradually took an opposing stance against hongan-ji temple , having bukko-ji temple and senju-ji temple as their bases .
jodo shinshu in those days had active missionary work in bukko-ji temple and senju-ji temple and acquired a number of followers , but hongan-ji temple just existed as a branch temple of tendai shu before the 8th head-priest rennyo .
from emergence of rennyo to ishiyama hongan-ji war
rennyo ( 1415-1499 ) , the 8th head-priest of hongan-ji temple , who emerged in the late muromachi period , established an organization called kou against the backdrop of the growth of the public at the time , provided the opportunity for people to learn the teachings equally and to come together , and wrote " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " explaining the teachings of shinran in plain words and disseminated it widely to the public .
by his achievement , hongan-ji temple rapidly developed and expanded , and came to be called ikko shu . ( on the contrary , other sects of shinshu went into decline . )
the strength of the group of followers in this kou was directed at politicians ( such as daimyo ) , despite rennyo 's restraint .
kokujin ( village heads ) and dogo ( powerful families ) converted to shinshu and joined the village people who were discontent with the system with complicated and multiple lordship in the end of the middle ages , and uprising called " ikko-ikki " were staged throughout the nation by united ikko shu followers from the whole county or province .
later , when the onin war ( 1467-1477 ) broke out and an internal conflict occurred between east and west squads in kaga province , north of yoshizaki gobo , as the base of hongan-ji temple at that time in echizen province , the monto of senshu-ji school took the side of kochiyo togashi who took part in the west squad , while the monto of honganji school , through the assistance of takakage asakura , the daimyo of echizen ( the 7th chief ) , took the side of masachika togashi , kochiyo 's brother and a former shugo deported from kaga , who belonged to east squad , and deported kochiyo in 1474 . ( in other words , ikko-ikki in kaga was started as a power struggle inside shinshu )
however , hongan-ji 's monto and masachika togashi opposed each other after that , and when masachika sent a force to subdue ikko shu in 1488 , they forced masachika to commit suicide by his sword , and achieved autonomous control ( however , masataka togashi of the togashi clan showed sympathy for ikko-ikki , and he remained shugo daimyo symbolically ) .
after that , the monto aimed to recapture the meeting house ( dojo ) in yoshizaki of which the asakura clan had deprived , and monto mustered from all over hokuriku area fought against the asakura clan more than once .
hongan-ji temple lost their headquarters by this incident , and moved it to a temple in ishiyama in osaka , which rennyo had built in his final years ( 1496 ) , and lived in ( ishiyama hongan-ji temple ) .
since then , osaka developed around the monastery of hongan-ji temple , comparable to a castle , and a temple town formed around it , and it strength frightened power people of the time .
in 1568 , when nobunaga oda conquered kinai and came into conflict with yoshiaki ashikaga who became the seii taishogun , kennyo ( 1543-1592 ) , the 11th head-priest of hongan-ji temple , took the side of yoshiaki ashikaga , and on september 12 , 1570 , suddenly attacked the camp of nobunaga , who was attacking the miyoshi clan .
responding to this , monto rose in revolt around the nation , and the uprising by gansho-ji temple in nagashima in ise province ( nagashima ikko-ikki ) brought down kokie castle in owari province .
( later , hideyoshi toyotomi constructed osaka castle in the area including the site of ishiyama hongan-ji temple . )
as described above , ikko-ikki was one of the biggest forces in japanese society at the time and ranked with sengoku daimyo ( warlords ) , but all the monto of shinshu did not go along with this movement .
as seen in the case of the battle between hongan-ji monto and senshu-ji school monto ( takada monto and shinshu sanmonto school ) in echizen province , some shinshu sects other than hongan-ji had a conflicting movement .
reconstruction in kyoto
in the days of hideyoshi toyotomi , in 1591 , kennyo was given land in the center of kyoto ( shichijo-horikawa , kyoto city ) and reconstructed hongan-ji temple .
by this incident , hongan-ji temple , which had the biggest religious influence at the time , was split into west ( current jodo shinshu hongan-ji school , shinshu kosho school , etc . ) with junnyo ( 1577-1630 ) , kennyo 's third son , as the 12th head-priest , and east ( current shinshu otani school , etc . ) with kyonyo , the oldest son , as the 12th head-priest .
furthermore , there exists a new religion related to jodo shinshu , which is connected to folk beliefs over a long period of history .
currently , it is made up of 10 schools affiliated to jodo shinshu sects and other schools , and as a whole sect , it has the most temples ( about 22,000 temples ) and followers among japanese buddhist sects .
shinshu kyodan rengo was organized as an association of shinshu sects to promote cooperation and coordination among the sects in 1923 , the 750th anniversary of shinran sho 'nin 's birth and the 700th anniversary of foundation of the religion .
the affiliated organizations are the following 10 schools , which are called " shinshu jippa " .
kinshoku-ji temple ( yasu city , shiga prefecture ) , 250 branch temples
gosho-ji temple ( echizen city , fukui prefecture ) , 67 branch temples
sensho-ji temple ( fukui city , fukui prefecture ) , 41 branch temples
shogen-ji temple ( fukui city , fukui prefecture ) , 8 branch temples
joko-ji temple ( higashi-ku , fukuoka city ) , 5 branch temples
kengo-in temple ( kita-ku , kyoto city )
the sects that separated after ohigashi sodo
higashi hongan-ji temple ( taito-ku , tokyo ) - the oldest son kosho otani , 324 branch and affiliated temples .
founded as a religious corporation in february in 2007 .

jurakudai ( or jurakutei ) was a large residence built by hideyoshi toyotomi in uchino , kyoto ( the site of the outer palace precincts in heiankyo , present-day kamigyo ward , kyoto city ) during the azuchi-momoyama period .
also called jurakutei .
the construction of jurakudai began in february 1586 , as an office and an official residence of hideyoshi , who became kanpaku ( chief advisor to the emperor ) , a chief councilor to the emperor , and completed in september 1586 .
after hideyoshi conquered kyushu , he moved into jurakudai from osaka to administer political affairs .
also , he gave an audience to tensho shonen shisetsu ( boys ' envoys to europe during the tensho era ) and ieyasu tokugawa in jurakudai .
although being called " -dai " ( meaning tei / house ) , jurakudai was in fact a castle on a plain , since it included several enclosed areas such as a donjon with a castle tower in the center and a secondary enclosure around it , and was surrounded with a moat .
within jurakudai , houses for hideyoshi 's aides , sen no rikyu et al. were built .
kitano tenman-gu shrine , where the kitano grand tea ceremony was held in october 1587 , is located nearby uchino , where jurakudai was .
in 1594 , hideyoshi began construction of fushimi-jo castle for his residence after his retirement , and in 1595 , because of an adverse relationship with hideyoshi , hidetsugu was sent to mt . koya-san and then ordered to commit suicide , thereafter jurakudai was demolished .
it is known that jurakudai was once called " uchino okamai " ( or uchino no onkamae ) during construction , which first appears in " tamon-in nikki " ( the diary of tamon-in temple ) , in the section of february 27 , 1586 , ' the construction of uchino okamai began on the last 21st . '
as to the origin of the name " juraku , " there is a description of ' the place for gathering ( ju ) songs and dances ( raku ) for longevity ' in " jurakudai gyoko-ki " ( the diary of visit to jurakudai ) written by hideyoshi 's aide , yuko omura , one of " tensho-ki " ( the diary of tensho ) .
since no other sources have been found so far , historians generally believe that the term " juraku " was created by hideyoshi .
there is no recognizable structure of jurakudai remaining today , except that the landscape bears its mark .
in addition , there remains a garden stone supposedly contributed by kiyomasa kato in bundo-cho , to the north of kyoto city , demizu , day service center in chiekoin-dori , demizu-dori , sagaru , but there is also no evidence to show that it is a remnant of jurakudai .
also , there are many towns named after warlords who served under hideyoshi , such as nyosui-cho , kodera-cho , ukita-cho , hidadono-cho , tamura-bizen-cho , fukushima-cho , chusho-cho , and naoie-cho .
there is a monument to jurakudai to the north of seishin elementary school in jofukuji-dori , nakadachiuri-dori .
" nijo shin-yashiki " ( hideyoshi 's before jurakudai ) of hideyoshi hashiba ( toyotomi ) of nijo-jo castle ,
a list of castles in japan
the term " shijin-so-o " refers to the topography and land physiognomy that are traditionally believed to be the best suited for the ' four gods ' that govern the four directions of the heavens in china , korea and japan .
the four gods with an ' oryu ' ( yellow dragon ) or kirin at their center are called the ' go-jin ' ( five gods ) .
however , the correspondence between the four gods and actual geography in japan differs greatly from that in china , south korea , and north korea .
shijin-so-o topography in the feng shui of china and korea indicates the form of zofujusui ( storing wind and collecting water ) in which the terrain is enclosed by having tall mountains at the back ( haizan-rinsui ) , a lake , river , or sea in the front ( sui ) , and smaller hills or mountains ( sa ) on both sides .
however , ogura-ike pond was completely consumed by landfills , which broke the shijin-so-o topography of kyoto .
mt . funaoka , which once overlooked suzaku-oji avenue , is a little too small for genbu .
in the standard viewpoint of feng shui , mt . funaoka is interpreted as seiho , to which sanryu , a dragon of mountains , is headed via genbu .
in modern japan , the interpretation that the four gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake , ' as shown in the following table , is generally accepted .
however , this association has not necessarily been settled since ancient times .
the " sakuteiki gardening book " is source of the theory that equates the four gods to ' mountain , river , road and lake . '
it also explains that planting certain kinds of trees can substitute ' the four gods = mountain , river , road and lake ' in the event there is no mountain , river , road and lake to represent the four gods .
the interpretation that the four gods are related to ' mountain , river , road and lake ' has been generally accepted in modern japan , since the association of seiryu = kamo-gawa river ( the yodo-gawa river system ) , byakko = sanin-do road , suzaku = ogura-ike pond and genbu = mt . funaoka was relatively successful with heian-kyo as a model .
therefore , we need to pay attention to the fact that there is no proof of the argument based on the assumption that this theory is the ideological background for choosing the land for heian-kyo , which was built in the late eighth century .
in fact , even though a city prior to the edo period would have been designed to match the shijin-so-o topography , it is very unlikely that the four gods were mountain , river , road and lake .
right now , the place of heijo is in accordance with the painting of four beasts ; three mountains assuage things , and turtle augury tells the same . '
the phrase ' accordance with the painting of four beasts ' here means shijin-so-o topography , which confirms that during the nara period heijo-kyo was considered to be the place having shijin-so-o topography .
the location of heijo-kyo doesn 't apply to a mountain , river , road and lake as described for heian-kyo .
however , as long as it is associated with shijin-so-o topography it is likely that another interpretation would have been accepted during the nara period .
shirin saiyo-sho commentary in the late kamakura period mentions that ' the central mountains are related to genbu , and the people , panoply and oven are related to suzaku ... , ' which shows that suzaku was associated with ' people , panoply and oven . '
moreover , " ryueihikan " mentions that ' winds of the edo castle merit the position of the world 's castle , and its land coincides with shijin-so-o topography ' .
it is far-fetched to say that such geography matches the theory of ' four gods = mountain , river , road and lake . '
furthermore , the interpretation that himeji castle , fukuyama castle ( bingo-no-kuni ) or kumamoto castle matches the shijin-so-o topography of ' mountain , river , road and lake ' theory emerged later .
there is no concept of certain fortune on a certain direction in the feng shui of ancient china , so it is an original japanese concept to abhor kimon ( the direction of northeast , called an ogre gate ) and urakimon ( the direction of southwest which is the opposite side of kimon ) .
this is how the interpretation of shijin-so-o topography has changed from ancient times to the early modern times , and it is believed to be unique and different from the feng shui of ancient china .
grand sumo - the four tassels with different colors above the sumo ring were relics of four pillars that originally held up the roof of kataya , indicating the four gods .
emperor uda was the seventh prince of emperor koko .
his mother was empress dowager hanshi-joo , who was the daughter of emperor kammu 's son , imperial prince nakano .
although he once left the imperial family and was granted the surname of genji and called minamoto no sadami , he returned to the imperial family on august 29 , 887 with the help of kampaku , chief adviser to the emperor , fujiwara no mototsune , and became a prince on august 30 , 888 .
this is strongly related to the fact that emperor uda was the adopted son of naishi no tsukasa fujiwara no yoshiko , who was mototsune 's half-sister .
he became emperor on november 21 , the day emperor koko passed away due to ill health .
fujiwara no inshi was one of the wives of emperor uda when he was young , and was a daughter of naidaijin fujiwara no takafuji .
because she lived in higashi-shichijo-no-miya during the last part of her life , she was also called higashi-shichijo-ko or shichijo-ko .
sugawara no enshi ( hiroko ) was a daughter of sugawara no michizane .
the imperial throne was passed to emperor daigo , and later emperor uda became a high priest at ninna-ji temple .
on the other hand , the relationship with the retired emperor yozei was tense .
according to an anecdotal story in " okagami ( the great mirror ) , " the retired emperor yozei said that emperor uda used to serve him . it is also said to have been a big headache for the retired emperor uda as emperor yozei had tried to restore his government .
although the affair was settled by emperor 's concession , the emperor was smarter than mototsune believed he was , and he changed the government into the " shinse " style ; for example , he appointed sugawara no michizane to a position of trust .
the emperor uda wrote " kampyo-goyuikai " / " kampyo-no-goyuikai ( a group of precepts for governing ) " and " kampyo-gyoki ( emperor uda 's diary ) . "
it is said that the emperor uda took actual control of the government while emperor daigo remained sick in his last years .
some people said that " engi-tenryaku-no-chi , " which was supposed to be governed well by emperor daigo and emperor murakami , should be called " kampyo-no-chi , " since the actual politics were based on emperor uda 's ( priest in a high position ) style .
there was a big waka ( japanese poetry ) ceremony called " teiji-in uta-awase , " which was held after emperor uda came to power , thus representing the great influence of the kokufu bunka ( japan 's original national culture ) .
he was also called kampyo-hoo , teijinoin and dajo-emperor suzakuin .
the imperial mausoleum is located at ouchiyama no misasagi , in uda-no-tani , narutaki , ukyo-ku , kyoto city .
all the emperors are enshrined in koreiden , one of the kyuchu-sanden ( three shrines of the imperial court ) .
the sumitomo family is the founding family of sumitomo zaibatsu .
origin of the sumitomo family : earliest ancestor , progenitor , and business founder
earliest ancestor of the sumitomo family
the surname of sumitomo originates from kotaro ( tadashige ) , the twenty-second-generation descendant of takamochi-oh , a great grandson of emperor kanmu , who took the surname " sumitomo " after the surname and given name of his father , masami hirauchi tomosada , who lived at the end of the sengoku period ; and kotaro served shogun muromachi and was appointed as the bichumori guard .
the ancestors of the sumitomo family , who were sengoku samurai and descendants of heike , lived during the tumultuous period of japanese history known as the sengoku period ( period of warring states ) , when warriors fought each other in order to expand their lands .
moreover , sadanobu 's son sadashige served yoshitada imagawa ( the grandfather of yoshimoto imagawa ) . after the imagawa clan was destroyed during nobusada 's lifetime , sadashige 's son served kiyohide nakagawa in settsu , calling himself the guardian of irie tosanokami . he was known as one of the " sixteen horses of nakagawa " , but died during the battle of ozaki .
masatoshi 's son nagamichi was employed by hideyasu yuki , who was a son of ieyasu tokugawa and was adopted as a son-in-law by the yuki family , thus ending the history of the sumitomo as a samurai family .
nagamichi , who might have felt the severity and heartlessness of the ups and downs of the society of samurai families ( although that was the way of sengoku ) , ordered his children to leave the world of samurai families .
the first generation , masatomo , foundation of " fujiya "
nagamichi 's second son , masatomo sumitomo , who had inherited the family estate instead of his elder brother kobe , was born during the tensho era , studied under giyuishonin-kugen ( the founder of the nehan-shu sect ) and became a buddhist who called himself " monjuin kuzen . "
masatomo , who was considered the omniscient successor of the nehan-shu sect , returned to secular life after the nehan-shu sect was absorbed into the tendai-shu sect during the kanei era and opened " fujiya , " a business dealing with books and pharmaceuticals in rakuchu ( called himself kakyu ) , and started a hardworking life .
this marked the beginning of the sumitomo family as merchants .
masatomo wrote instructions pertaining to business in " monjuin 's directions , " which remains the prototype for company codes in each company of the sumitomo group to the present day .
the founder of a family and founder of the sumitomo family business , the foundation of senoku
in the sumitomo family there are two distinctions : the " founder of a family " in the sumitomo family , and the " founder of a business " of the sumitomo family .
riemon soga , who was the husband of kakyu 's elder sister and a dealer in copper who believed in the nehan-shu sect and was a buddhist parishioner of ku-zen ( masatomo ) , gave masatomo material and mental support when masatomo returned to the secular life and opened " fujiya . "
he is the ninth generation of tadashige .
at that time it wasn 't known in japan that gold , silver and the like were contained in crude copper , nor was the refining technique for separating gold and silver known .
riemon learned from hakusui of minjin the refining method and kept it secret , and thanks to the nanban-fuki copper refining method the sumitomo family gained enormous profit by extracting silver from crude copper .
excavation at the besshidozan copper mine in iyo was started in the 4th year of genroku , which was during the lifetime of tomoyoshi sumitomo , a grandchild of riemon tomomochi sumitomo .
this developed into a mine that boasted the world 's greatest copper production , supporting japan as an important export item and serving as the major sumitomo business for approximately 280 years .
the foundation of today 's sumitomo family , or the starting point of sumitomo zaibatsu , can be said to have been built by the besshidozan copper mine that tomoyoshi sumitomo developed ; and in fact , in the history of the sumitomo family , the fourth-generation kichizaemon tomoyoshi is considered to be the " restorer of the sumitomo family . "
during the meiji era the sumitomo family was engaged in cultural enterprises , and the fifteenth-generation kichizaemon tomoito sumitomo donated the building that would become the osaka prefectural nakanoshima library .
incidentally , it was from the third-generation head of the sumitomo family , tomonobu sumitomo ( son of tomomochi ) , that the heads of the sumitomo family began calling themselves " kichizaemon . "
the sumitomo family in sumitomo zaibatsu
the sumitomo family in sumitomo zaibatsu , specifically since tomoito sumitomo , took the position , " ( he ) reigns but does not govern . "
all the duties of the successive kichizaemon as president of the zaibatsu ( main company ) are the repository of trust in the head of the directors of the main sumitomo company ( sumitomo limited partnership corporation ) ; therefore , the successive kichizaemon did not give any specific orders to the individual businesses .
additionally , although kanichi and moto , who were brothers of the sixteenth-generation kichizaemon tomonari , were stockholders of the sumitomo main company , they were never named as executives of the main company or any of its subsidiary companies .
in this respect the sumitomo family can be said to be in contrast with the mitsui and iwasaki families .
however , this does not mean there was any kind of tension between the zaibatsu family and executives of the zaibatsu main company or the subsidiary companies , as the mitsui zaibatsu had .
designation of the zaibatsu family
in november 1947 , in an effort to disperse the power to control business by the zaibatsu family and to break up the human relationships , the zaibatsu family was designated and " zaibatsu douzoku shihairyoku haijo hou ' 48 [ law for the termination of zaibatsu family control ] was established .
the holding company liquidation commission , in accordance with the order by the forces of the allied occupation , selected the standards by which to determine the scope of the zaibatsu family as follows :
one million yen or more as the total of securities , cash , deposits and savings .
a stockholder who would have a stake of 10 % or more of stocks issued by the company in question .
the power to control the business or influence management
according to the above-mentioned standards , in february 1947 the following people among the sumitomo family were designated as the zaibatsu family :
relatives and marriages of the sumitomo family
at the beginning of the meiji era , the sumitomo enterprise was run by kichizaemon tomochika ( the twelfth-generation kichizaemon ) and his son kichizaemon tomotada ( the thirteenth-generation kichizaemon ) . misfortune struck the sumitomo family , however , with the passing of their male heirs when tomochika and then tomotada died in 1890 .
takamaro tokudaiji became the fifteenth-generation kichizaemon tomoito sumitomo , as a brother of sanetsune tokudaiji and kinmochi saionji .
tomoito sumitomo and his wife masu , who was tomochika 's eldest daughter , had four sons ( the third son died while still a child ) and one daughter .
however , since the eldest son , kanichi , was disinherited , the second son , atsushi , became head of the sumitomo family , adopting the name kichizaemon tomonari to become the sixteenth-generation kichizaemon .
kichizaemon tomonari sumitomo married haruko , a second daughter of the duke hachiro saionji , the former togu-shoku goyo-gakari ( kinmochi saionji 's daughter 's husband , the eighth son of the duke motonori mori , a feudal lord of old nagato-no-kuni , of the domain of yamaguchi ( domain of choshu ) ) .
tomonari and haruko , as husband and wife , had no sons but had two daughters ; the first daughter , kuniko , married ikumi ( a science faculty professor at tokyo university ) , who was the first son of yukisada sasaki , a former marquess who had served in the position of the former isejingu daiguji .
the former marquess yukisada sasaki , an authority on kokushi ( national history ) , was appointed as head of koten kokyujo and president of kokugakuin university in 1942 , and then served as the president of kokushi-henshu-in , guji of tokyo daijingu in 1946 and daiguji of ise jingu in 1951 .
yukisada 's grandfather takayuki sasaki was privy councilor and a head of education for harunomiya ( taisho emperor ) .
because emiko 's elder sister , or shoda 's first daughter , is michiko ( of the imperial family ) , the sumitomo family is related by marriage to the imperial family through the anzai and shoda families .
moreover , because the person who married naoyuki anzai 's younger sister kimiko was kensuke hotta ( sumitomo bank ) , the first son of shozo hotta , who was sodanyaku of sumitomo bank , shozo hotta , who was the former iincho of the sumitomo family council after shigeru okahashi became related by keibatsu , there was a keibatsu blood connection to the sumitomo family through the sodanyaku of sumitomo bank , at the soriji rank .
kinkazu saionji , who was a former member of the house of councilors and worked to improve ties between china and japan , is the eldest son of hachiro saionji and the eldest brother of haruko and fujio .
tomonari sumitomo 's younger brother , moto sumitomo , married sueko , the seventh daughter of earl tadaie sakai , who was the feudal lord of the domain of the former obama ( 14,000 koku ) .
sueko 's elder sister , kaeko , married the former earl yorihiro matsudaira ( riji of hongo gakuen ) , who was the descendant of the feudal lord of the domain of the former takamatsu .
sueko 's elder sister , saeko , married a grandchild of yataro iwasaki , the founder of mitsubishi zaibatsu , and her daughter yuriko ( niece of sueko ) married kiyotaka chinzei ( professor emeritus at kyoto university ) , who was included on a list of important figures as a doctor ( science ) of paleontology .
as mentioned above , since he devoted himself to painting when he was young , he lost his right to inheritance , and thereafter he lived as a painter and art collector and was on close terms with ryusei kishida .
nearly all the chinese calligraphy and paintings in the possession of senoku-hakuko-kan are from kanichi 's collection .
the tearoom of " murakami-tei , " which is designated as an important building of the kamakura city landscape , was transferred from kanichi 's house in kamakura .
kanichi and his wife , a daughter of munemitsu minagawa , had four sons and two daughters .
their eldest son , tsutomu sumitomo , served as president of the former sumitomo business consulting and sumitomo australia development .
yoko , the wife of tsutomu sumitomo 's eldest son susumu ( nec corporation ) , is the second daughter of tokuro iwase , who is president of toso sangyo co . ltd .
tokuro iwase 's father , tokusaburo , was president of the former toyo soda manufacturing co . , ltd .
the eldest daughter of tokuro iwase married kenzaburo , who was adopted by the eleventh-generation shichi-zaemon mogi , a member of the kikkoman ( corporation ) family .
as a result , the family of kanichi sumitomo , who was a brother of the kichizaemon , was related to the mogi family by marriage twice over .
tsutomu sumitomo 's younger brother masaru married momoe , a daughter of hachiro asano , the president of the former kanto denko .
hachiro asano is the third son of souichiro asano , who was the second-generation sosui of asano zaibatsu .

he graduated from the kyoto university department of physics in 1936 , and started working for sumitomo metal industries , ltd . , in 1946 .
moto sumitomo 's eldest son , yoshio sumitomo , is also a doctor of engineering , having graduated from the osaka university graduate school 's doctoral course in basic engineering ; however , since his uncle , family head kichizaemon sumitomo , had no legitimate son to be an heir , yoshio was adopted by the family head kichizaemon .
as mentioned above , the sumitomo family had a close keibatsu blood connection with former nobility over the two generations , starting with the previous generation .
speaking of the connection with the former noble , in addition to the descendant of kanichi , the elder brother of the family head kichizaemon , mitsuko , who was the wife of the fourth child toru , was a daughter of the former duke hiromichi takatsukasa .
for example , kinto tokudaiji , the father of the family head ( two generations ago ) tomoito sumitomo , duke kinmochi saionji and duke sanetsune tokudaiji , who was the former grand chamberlain , was adopted from the takatsukasa family by the tokudaiji family .
as mentioned above , the sumitomo family has a family line with a close keibatsu , keibatsu blood connection with former nobles , particularly the highest-ranking sekke--the seiga family--and if the sumitomo family is the western yokozuna among the old zaibatsu , the sumitomo family also has a close connection with the mitsui family , the eastern yokozuna .
it is said that when naramitsu married into the mitsui family , seven freight cars were hired to send wedding dresses from osaka to tokyo .
however , the connection with the mitsui family is not only as mentioned above .
moreover , the former viscount tadakazu tori , who was the elder brother of tadateru--a husband of the elder sister of the head of family kichizaemon--married hiroko , who was the eldest daughter of hachiro-jiro , the eighth-generation mitsui-minami family .

every year on april 25 , presidents , chairpersons and sodanyaku of direct affiliates of the sumitomo group gather to attend the " shido-sai " held in " ariyoshi-en , " which was historically a sumitomo-ke bettei in shishigadani in kyoto higashiyama , where " gozan-no-okuribi " is performed .
there is a small shrine called " hosendo " in a corner of ariyoshi-en , which covers an area of approximately 9,900 square meters .
that is , " shido-sai " is a day on which the family head of the sumitomo family and the highest-ranking executive officers such as presidents , chairpersons and sodanyaku of direct affiliates of the sumitomo group gather once a year for the " memorial service for the deceased . "

the name can also refer to the area including kasamatsu park , which has a view of amanohashidate .
it got its name from the fact that if you look at it upside-down , it looks like a bridge across the sky .
because it looks like a dragon climbing into the sky ) , is also popular , drawing just as many tourists as the north side .
from " amanohashidate-zu " by sesshu , shown at left ) ; and the view from the west is called " ichijikan " (
because it looks like the kanji character for 1 , or ichi ) .
since the edo period it has been counted as one of japan 's three scenic views , along with matsushima ( current miyagi prefecture ) and miyajima ( current hiroshima prefecture ) .

amanohashidate has shrunk in recent years due to erosion , and is in danger of disappearing .
this is because dams were built on the rivers after the war , reducing the amount of sediment carried from the mountains to the sea , and destroying the balance of sediment deposits and erosion on amanohashidate .
at one time the trees were blighted by pine weevils , and were in danger of being wiped out .
muromachi bakufu was a samurai government established by takauji ashikaga .
it was japan 's second bakufu government , following the kamakura bakufu .
the name ' muromachi ' was derived from the muromachi-dono , which was built by yoshimitsu ashikaga , the third ashikaga shogun , to serve as the public residence of the shogun ( commonly known as hana no gosho , this residence is located in what is now kamigyo ward , kyoto city ) .
there are two views regarding the year of muromachi bakufu 's establishment--in november 1336 , when the administrative policies of bakufu were set up ( being clearly indicated as kenmu shikimoku ) , or in 1338 , when takauji ashikaga was assigned as seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) by emperor komyo of jimyoin-to faction ( 持明院統 ) ; however , the former view is more convincing .
regarding the time when the bakufu ended , it virtually ended in 1573 when the fifteenth shogun , yoshiaki ashikaga , was banished from kyoto by nobunaga oda .
furthermore , the period until the unification of hokucho and nancho is called the period of the northern and southern courts , and the period after the onin war ( 1467 ) or the meio incident ( 1493 ) is called the age of civil war ( japan ) .
because procedures for the removal of seii taishogun were not implemented even after yoshiaki ashikaga 's banishment from kyoto , he was still treated as a shogun by the powers opposed to nobunaga .
" kugyo-bunin " treated yoshiaki as a shogun until february 9 1588 , when he followed hideyoshi toyotomi , chief adviser to the emperor , and visited the imperial palace , vowed loyalty to hideyoshi and was granted status as ju-sangu .
the staff organization of muromachi bakufu is more or less adapted from the organization of kamakura bakufu .
government during the initial period was unstable , partly because nancho still existed .
also , a government structure was assigned with the shogun at the top , along with samurai-dokoro , government office , monchu-jo , hyojo-shu , hikitsuke-shu as the control with the role of supporting the shogun .
also , hoko-shu was formed as the military power directly under the control of the shogun .
the collapse of the public ownership system of manors = transfer to the system of ownership by shugo daimyos and the development of a monetary economy are part of the characteristics of muromachi bakufu .
in the kamakura period , individual gokenin directly paid homage to the shogun ( although there were exceptions such as being hired by a strong gokenin ) , and shugos were mere supervisors of gokenin within their lands .
subsequently , even shugo daimyos with power exceeding that of shogun muromachi were born .
however , while there were cases in which the bakufu subdued individual shugo daimyos , there was no case where a shugo daimyo and shogun muromachi were fully in conflict with each other .
the shugo daimyos proceeded to exercise control over their lands by the authority that they were assigned to the position of shugo by bakufu .
therefore , no matter how much they expanded their power , they could not afford to deny the authority of shogun muromachi .
after all , if the authority of the shogun were to be eroded , so too would that of the shugo daimyo .
also , four shoguns who died in their place of exile ( the tenth , yoshitane ashikaga ; eleventh , yoshizumi ashikaga ; twelfth , yoshiharu ashikaga ; and fourteenth , yoshihide ashikaga ) .
upon the occurrence of kanno no joran , takauji ashikaga established the kamakura government in kamakura as an organization to control 10 countries in the east .
the position as chief of this organization was succeeded by the descendant of motouji ashikaga , a son of takauji , who served the position of kanto control ( 関東管領 ) .
throughout the muromachi period , kamakura-kubo ( 鎌倉公方 ) was opposed to bakufu and also became gradually opposed to the uesugi clan , who held the position of kanto control .
however , horikoshi-kubo was also defeated after masatomo 's death by moritoki ise ( soun hojo ) , a major vassal of the imagawa clan , and this ended in failure .
also , koga-kubo , after splitting off oyumi-kubo ( 小弓公方 ) , was made a puppet of the go-hojo clan , who were descendants of moritoki .
in kyushu , kyushu tandai , headquartered in hakata ( fukuoka city , fukuoka prefecture ) , was established .
in the tohoku region oshu control ( 奥州管領 ) was established , which was abolished when two countries of ou became under the control of kamakura-fu , and during a certain period inamura-kubo ( 稲村公方 ) and sasagawa-kubo ( 篠川公方 ) were established .
oshu tandai ( 奥州探題 ) was established during the era of yoshimitsu ashikaga , and iekane shiba was assigned .
ushu tandai ( 羽州探題 ) split after the death of iekane , and the shiba clan of dewa became the mogami clan .
upon the abasement of the shogun 's authority after the onin rebellion , sankan shishiki ( other than the hosokawa clan ) also fell , and when in the middle of the age of civil war the power of the hosokawa clan weakened , the various systems of muromachi bakufu became mere terms .
the majority of the financial income of muromachi bakufu came from goryo-sho ( 御料所 ) , which was directly controlled by bakufu ; but often , during the war of the northern and southern courts , the goryo-sho became a target and were taken by the opposing nancho side , or were given away as rewards for one 's own army , and the scale of goryo-sho is considered to be smaller than that of kamakura bakufu or edo bakufu .
furthermore , when a permanent right to charge yakusen ( 役銭 ) from doso ( 土倉 ) and sakaya ( 酒屋 ) in kyoto was allowed during the era of yoshimitsu ashikaga , yakusen were charged together with tansen , munabetsu-sen , etc . , by the doso appointed by bakufu , who were referred to as nosen-kata .
furthermore , when yoshimitsu initiated trade between japan and ming , profit by chubunsen ( 抽分銭 ) also became the income of bakufu .
furthermore , since the latter half of the fifteenth century , action was taken to make the yamashiro province ( within kyoto ) a goryo-sho .
the people who compose waka are called kajin poets .
waka is a name in contrast to the chinese poetry , and it is also called yamatouta ( 大和歌 ・ 倭歌 ) or just uta .
in the nara period it was called waka ( 倭歌 ) or washi ( 倭詩 ) .
therefore , it is also called misohitomoji ( 31 syllables . )
also , it is called yakumo , the name of which is based on the first word of the poem susanoo ( a deity in japanese mythology ) composed , and the poem is considered the first waka in japanese mythology : ' clouds ( yakumo ) , actively upwelling covered the eightfold fence.it makes the eightfold fence to have my new wife stay in the house.great eightfold fence . '
just like ' yakumo-no-michi , ' ' shikishima-no-michi ( roads in japan ) ' means kado .
shikishima means yamato or japan , so it literally means ' roads in japan . '
it suggests that to compose poems was the japanese traditional culture .
also , there is a unique form of poem called ryuka ( ryukyu poetry ) in okinawa prefecture .
waka means uta ( song ) and fixed-form poetry consisting of five and seven syllables and written in yamato-kotoba ( a word of purely japanese origin ) .
it is a half-poem that is sung by one of the two people , and it is the shortest poem .
two tercets of five , seven and seven syllables each
it is a repeated form of katauta , and most of the sedoka is mondoka ( dialogue poem ) .
it consists of alternating lines of five and seven syllables , and ends with an extra seven-syllable line .
choka was mainly composed in public , and was followed by hanka ( envoi ) .
it was created in the middle of the heian period .
it was created in the edo period .
it is often seen in minyo ( folk songs ) of all areas in japan .
it is also said that the name of dodoitsu appeared after the last days of the tokugawa government .
